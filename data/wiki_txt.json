["There are many bilingual street signs across Chinatown, denoting the name of streets, lanes, and roads in both English and Chinese. Interestingly, some of the names are based on their Cantonese pronunciation (e.g. Hay Street, which is pronounced \"hei1 gaai1\" in Cantonese, but \"x\u01d0 ji\u0113\" in Mandarin\") whilst others are based on their Mandarin pronunciation (e.g. Liverpool Street, which is pronounced \"l\u00ecw\u00f9p\u016d ji\u0113\" in Mandarin, but \"lei6mat6pou2 gaai1\" in Cantonese). \n\nSome of these signs are accompanied by their official City of Sydney street signs.

It tracked west-northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Georges on September\u00a016. Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperature and good upper-level outflow allowed the storm to rapidly deepen. By September\u00a020, Georges peaked as a 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a04 hurricane. However, it weakened due to increasing vertical wind shear and winds were 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) when the storm made landfall in Antigua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Puerto Rico on September\u00a021. Georges made another landfall in the Dominican Republic with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a022. It weakened significantly over Hispaniola, and late on September\u00a023, Georges struck eastern Cuba with winds of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). The storm tracked inland near the north coast of Cuba, retaining hurricane-force winds. On September\u00a025, the storm struck Key West with winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h). After heading northwestward for three days, Georges struck Biloxi at the same intensity. Georges quickly weakened to a tropical depression on September\u00a029, by which time it turned eastward through the Southeastern United States. By October\u00a01, it dissipated close to the Atlantic Ocean near the Florida-Georgia border.\nAbout 2,125\u00a0homes were either damaged or destroyed in Antigua and Barbuda, with property losses reaching $160\u00a0million; there were also 3\u00a0deaths. Roughly 60% of structures on Saint Kitts were damaged, as were 35% of structures in Nevis. Five deaths and $445\u00a0million in damage were reported in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico left 96% of the island without electricity, impacted at least 100,610\u00a0homes, wiped out more than two-thirds of crops, and caused 8\u00a0deaths and $2\u00a0billion in losses. Heavy precipitation in Dominican Republic caused mudslides, which left about 155,000\u00a0homeless and damaged buildings and road infrastructure. Additionally, it destroyed 55% of crops, caused at least 380\u00a0deaths, and left about $1.2\u00a0billion in losses. The situation was similar in Haiti, where mudslides left 167,332\u00a0people homeless, at least 80% of certain crops ruined, 209\u00a0persons dead, and about $179\u00a0million in damage. In Cuba, mudslides and strong winds damaged 60,475\u00a0homes, of which 3,481\u00a0were completely destroyed. Additionally 1,117\u00a0businesses were damaged, of which 12\u00a0were destroyed.

In Alabama, 251\u00a0houses, 16\u00a0apartment buildings, and 70\u00a0businesses experienced significant impacts at Gulf Shore. About 50\u00a0houses were destroyed and another 40\u00a0were left uninhabitable on Dauphin Island, Alabama. One fatality was reported in Mobile when a woman was driving and slid off the road into a creek. Mississippi bore the brunt of the storm in the United States. Along the coast of Mississippi, more than 1,000\u00a0homes were flooded. One of the worst impacted areas inland was Stone County, where 54\u00a0homes had minor damage, 26\u00a0suffered major damage and 5\u00a0were destroyed.

Most early television licenses were granted to established radio broadcasters, and many longtime relationships with radio networks carried over to the new medium. As CBS and NBC (and to a lesser extent, ABC) gained their footing, they began to offer programming that drew on their radio backgrounds, bringing over the most popular radio stars. Early television station owners, when deciding which network would receive their main affiliation, were more likely to choose CBS's roster of Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, and Ed Sullivan, or NBC's lineup of Milton Berle and Sid Caesar, over DuMont, which offered a then-unknown Jackie Gleason and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen. In smaller markets, with a limited number of stations, DuMont and ABC were often relegated to secondary status, so their programs got clearance only if the primary network was off the air or delayed via kinescope recording (\"teletranscriptions\" in DuMont parlance).\nAdding to DuMont's troubles was the FCC's 1948 \"freeze\" on television license applications. This was done to sort out the thousands of applications that had come streaming in, but also to rethink the allocation and technical standards laid down prior to World War II. It became clear soon after the war that 12 channels (\"channel 1\" had been removed from television broadcasting use because storms and other types of interference could severely affect the quality of its signals) were not nearly enough for national television service. What was to be a six-month freeze lasted until 1952, when the FCC opened the UHF spectrum. The FCC, however, did not require television manufacturers to include UHF capability. In order to see UHF stations, most people had to buy expensive converters. Even then, the picture quality was marginal at best . Tied to this was a decision to restrict VHF allocations in medium- and smaller-sized markets. Meanwhile, television sets would not be required to have all-channel tuning until 1964, with the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act.\nForced to rely on UHF to expand, DuMont saw one station after another go dark due to dismal ratings. It bought small, distressed UHF station KCTY (channel 25) in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1954, but ran it for just three months before shutting it down at a considerable loss after attempting to compete with three established VHF stations.\nThe FCC's Dr. Hyman Goldin said in 1960, \"If there had been four VHF outlets in the top markets, there's no question DuMont would have lived and would have eventually turned the corner in terms of profitability.\"", "First lines\nFinal lines", "Ahmose-Sapair (also -Sipair) was a prince of the late Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt (1580 to 1550 BCE). He was probably a son of Pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and a brother of Ahmose I or the child of Ahmose I.\nDuring the Eighteenth Dynasty, he appears on several monuments. Such prominence is relatively rare in case of princes who never ascended to the throne, so it has been suggested that he might be identical with the unknown father of Thutmose I, who succeeded Sapair's nephew, the childless Amenhotep I.

(And other Acadians remained neutral in the contest between the French\u2013Wabanaki Confederacy forces and the British.) The Acadian militias achieved effective resistance for more than 75 years and through six wars before their eventual demise.

This second album, which was released in Puerto Rico on March 31, 2004, marked a drastic change in Ignacio's rock performance style, after the launch of 2000's \"El Mundo Al Rev\u00e9s\", a singer/songwriter effort, which was more pop oriented and completely in Spanish. \nThe record demonstrated Ignacio's evolution as an artist and songwriter plus the musical cohesiveness between his fellow band members that only comes from touring and playing together.\nConceived during the aftermath of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, \"Anormal\" (Abnormal) is a conceptual proposal that entwines 12 songs that narrate a process of existential conflicts. \"Hey t\u00fa (imb\u00e9cil)\" (Hey you (imbecile)), was the album's first single. The video for it was directed by Ignacio himself, and was done in the \"Phono/Gr\u00e1phico\" style, in which a collage of footage from an array of news and pop culture sources and personally edited by the artist, is constantly running synchronized with the music that's being played live. Images of explosions, aliens, military marches and political figures are part of the video that also includes a scene re-enactment of the sci-fi classic film \"A Clockwork Orange\", directed by Stanley Kubrick who Pe\u00f1a claims as a musical influence.\nProduced by Ignacio Pe\u00f1a, Iker Gastaminza and guitarist Tony Rijos, \"Anormal\" also includes a guest appearance by Gustavo Laureano, lead singer of La Secta AllStar, in \"Velocidad de escape\" and its English version, \"Any year, any room, any highway\". \nAnormal was recorded in Puerto Rico and mixed in Miami.

In order to achieve what was at the time previously unachievable speeds, a very high number of advanced features were incorporated into the design of the M.52; many of which had been the product of detailed study and acquired knowledge of supersonic aerodynamics. Wood summarises the qualities of the M.52's design as possessing \"all the ingredients of a high-performance aircraft of the late fifties and even some of the early sixties\".\nThe fuselage of the M.52 was cylindrical and, like the rest of the aircraft, was constructed of high tensile steel with light-alloy covering. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle-like arrangement placed over the upper area around it. The engine was positioned with its center of gravity coincident with that of the aircraft and the wings were attached to the main structure just aft of the engine. The use of a shock cone in the nose was another key design choice; the inlet cone slowed incoming air to the subsonic speeds determined by the engine, but with lower losses than a subsonic aircraft pitot intake. A retractable tricycle undercarriage was used. The nose wheel was positioned close to the pilot's feet and the main wheels were fitted onto the main fuselage, folding out under the wings when deployed.\nThe M.52 had very thin wings of biconvex section, which had been first proposed by Jakob Ackeret, as they gave a low level of drag. These wings were so thin that they were known to test pilots as 'Gillette' wings, named after the brand of razor. The wing tips were \"clipped\" to keep them clear of the conical shock wave that was generated by the nose of the aircraft. Both wide-chord ailerons and split-flaps were fitted to the wings. As a high speed wing of this shape and size had not been tested before, Miles produced a full-scale wooden model of the wing for aerodynamic testing purposes; other representative portions of the aircraft, such as the tailplane, would be similarly produced and underwent low-speed flight testing.\nThe Power Jets W.2/700 turbojet engine was intended to be the first powerplant for the M.52. Initial aircraft would have been powered by a less-capable 'interim' model of the W.2/700 and thus be limited to subsonic speeds only; it did not feature either the afterburner or the additional aft fan that were to be present on the projected more advanced version with which later-built M.52s would have been equipped. In addition to the W.2/700 engine, a centrifugal-flow jet engine, designs were prepared for the M.52 to be fitted with a variety of different engines and types of propulsion, including what would become the newer Rolls-Royce Avon axial-flow jet engine, and a liquid-fuel rocket motors.\nThe M.52's single pilot, who, for the intended first flight, would have been test pilot Eric Brown, would have flown the aircraft from a small cockpit which was set inside the shock cone at the nose of the aircraft. The pressurised cockpit, in which the pilot would have had to fly the aircraft in a semi-prone position, was complete with a curved windscreen that was aligned with the contours of the bullet-shaped nose. In the event of an emergency, the entire section could be jettisoned, the separation from the rest of aircraft being initiated via multiple cordite-based explosive bolts. Air pressure would force the detached capsule off the fuselage while a parachute would slow its descent; during the capsule's descent, the pilot would bail out at a lower altitude and then parachute to safety. In order to serve its role as a research aircraft, the M.52 was to be equipped with comprehensive flight instrumentation, including automated instrument recorders and strain gauging throughout the structure connected to an oscilloscope.", "Justin McCarthy (22 November 1830 \u2013 24 April 1912) was an Irish nationalist and Liberal historian, novelist and politician.

As of 2003, the Susquehannock State Forest, which almost entirely surrounds the park, covered 265,000 acres (107,000\u00a0ha), chiefly in Potter County with small tracts in Clinton and McKean counties.\nThe park traces its existence back to 1922, when the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry established three scenic areas in state forests as part of a \"plan for retaining their natural beauty\". One of these was the 6.5-mile (10.5\u00a0km) \"Cherry Springs Scenic Drive\" on the old Coudersport-Jersey Shore Turnpike. That same year, one of 16\u00a0\"Class B\" public campgrounds in the state forests was located on Cherry Springs Drive. These campgrounds were free for the public to use and all had potable water, picnic tables, a fireplace, garbage can, and a latrine. The land where the hotel sat was purchased by the state in 1932.\nLike many state parks in north central Pennsylvania, development of the facilities at Cherry Springs was the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a work relief program for young men from unemployed families. Established in 1933\u00a0as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, the CCC was designed to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. It operated in every U.S. state, and established ten CCC camps in the Susquehannock State Forest, of which eight were in Potter County.\nCherry Springs was home to CCC Camp S-136-Pa, which was established on May 27, 1933. According to the camp's 1936\u00a0History: \"Through the efforts of the [CCC] enrollees Cherry Springs Park, formerly a clearing, has been transformed into a park of which the people of Potter County can be proud of.\"[sic] A historic recreation of the original tavern was built, as were a rifle range, picnic tables and shelters, roads, and hiking trails. The young men of the CCC camps worked to clear brush from the woods as a fire prevention measure. After clearing the woods, they planted stands of Norway Spruce and white pine, as well as an apple orchard. Camp-136-Pa closed on July 10, 1937.\nMen from CCC Camp S-88-Pa, based at nearby Lyman Run in Potter County, were also active in the park. In 1939, they built a structure at Cherry Springs which is \"the largest and most unique of the CCC-built picnic pavilions\" in the state, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pavilion overlooks PA Route 44\u00a0and is shaped like an H, with two partially enclosed structures (the vertical lines of the H) connected by a breezeway (the horizontal bar). The breezeway is a roof supported by eight log columns with log railings. The ends of the pavilion are built from log walls with white chinking, like log cabins. Each end has a large opening to the breezeway in one wall, while the other three sides are fully enclosed with a large window in the wall facing the highway, a stone fireplace and chimney on the opposite wall, and a door flanked by windows on the wall opposite the breezeway.\nA 1984\u00a0survey of Pennsylvania state parks found the \"three picnic pavilions, and their associated latrines\" at Cherry Springs \"typical of the smallest day use areas constructed by the CCC\". These pavilions are examples of the rustic style built by the CCC in state parks throughout the Great Depression. Local materials were used in a way that minimized impact on the natural surroundings, and in a manner that resembled the building style of the pioneer settlements of the Appalachian Mountains.\nIn addition to the two CCC camps active at the park, Cherry Springs also was home to Camp Elliott, which was run by the Pennsylvania Depa", "The diplomatic relations between Austria and Azerbaijan established in 1992 after Austria recognized the independence of Azerbaijan.", "Loughborough Lake is a lake in Eastern Ontario, Canada.

The results of the competition are as follows. For a full explanation of the scoring system, qualification process, awards and records, see Sweet Adelines International competition.\nQualification for the competition happens as part of the regional chorus competition. The five highest-scoring small (division A, 15-30 singers) and midsize (division, AA 31\u201360 singers) choruses across all regional competitions qualify directly for the Harmony Classic of the following year. With five choruses in each of the two divisions (A & AA) a total of 10 choruses compete in this competition each year. Only one chorus from a region may compete in each of the divisions and the previous year's winner may not compete in the same division again the following year. Furthermore, a chorus may not compete in both the main competition and also the Harmony Classic at the same year. A chorus may potentially qualify for both the main chorus competition as well as the Harmony Classic, but are only permitted to compete in one, thereby making a space available for the next highest qualifier to take their place at the other competition.", "The Manacles (Cornish: Meyn Eglos, meaning church stones) (grid reference SW820205) are a set of treacherous rocks off The Lizard peninsula in Cornwall.

He calls the plan Vision 2020, and spurred a similar movement to redevelop the country's capital city, Kigali by 2040. Vision 2020 hopes to eliminate the informal settlements that currently exist, in a scheme similar in nature to that of urban renewal in America in the early twentieth century. The plan has also prioritized growth above all else, even if that means that the total amount of net official development assistance and official aid from foreign government grew by over 45% between 2006 and 2009.

At the time the Irish Free State was a separate Dominion within the British Commonwealth. In 1986, government policy during state visits to London was to fly the crosses of Saints George, Andrew and Patrick and the Welsh Dragon. The government clarified that the Union Flag was the flag of Northern Ireland, not the Saint Patrick's Saltire or the Ulster Banner.\nThe barge Gloriana during the 2012 Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant flew flags for the five \"home nations\" of the United Kingdom, including Saint Piran for Cornwall, Saint Andrew for Scotland, Saint George for England, Saint David for Wales and Saint Patrick's Saltire for Northern Ireland.

cooperation, seeing much service in the British Empire. The first Audax flew in late 1931 and over 700 Audaxes were produced (including export). The Audax was similar to the Hart, though had some modifications, including a hook to pick up messages. The Audax was armed with a single .303\u00a0in (7.7\u00a0mm) Lewis light machine gun and a .303\u00a0in (7.7\u00a0mm) Vickers machine gun. The Audax was powered by a version of the Kestrel engine and had a maximum speed of 170\u00a0mph (274\u00a0km/h). A number of variants of the Audax were produced, including the Audax India, a tropicalised version of the Audax for service in India and the Audax Singapore for service there.\nThe Audax saw service with other air forces, including the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Indian Air Force, the South African Air Force, the Royal Egyptian Air Force, the Royal Iraqi Air Force, the Imperial Iranian Air Force, the Straits Settlements and the Southern Rhodesian Air Force. The Audax saw limited service during the Second World War, seeing service in Africa on the Kenya\u2013Abyssinia border, the latter of which had been occupied by Italy. The Audax also saw service in Iraq, at RAF Habbaniya, west of Baghdad, after the uprising there, the Anglo-Iraqi War; influenced by Axis forces.\nThe battle for RAF Habbaniya: In the days leading up to the battle for RAF Habbaniya crews [Squadron Leader Tony Dudgeon for example] began to upgrade the Audaxs stationed there, despite having received orders forbidding such actions. They fitted some of the Audaxs to carry 250\u00a0lb [113\u00a0kg] bombs instead of 20\u00a0lb (9\u00a0kg) bombs.\nThe Audax ended its service by 1945. A derivative of the Audax, the Hawker Hartebeest, a light bomber, was built for the South African Air Force with modifications made from the Audax. Sixty-five of these aircraft were built, the majority in South Africa. The aircraft saw action in East Africa during clashes against Italy who occupied Abyssinia.\nA.V.

Despite such propaganda, however, this was never the actual nature of Werwolf, which in reality was always intended to be a commando unit comprising uniformed troops. Another popular myth about Werwolf is that it was intended to continue fighting underground even after the surrender of the Nazi government and the German military.\nNo officially recognized effort was ever made by the Nazi leadership to develop an insurgency to continue fighting in the event of defeat, in no small measure because Adolf Hitler, as well as other Nazi leaders, regarded anyone who even discussed the possibility as defeatists and traitors. As a result, no contingency plans to deal with defeat were ever authorized in the official, public record. However, as a result of Goebbels' efforts, Werwolf had, and in many cases continues to have, a mythological reputation as having been an underground Nazi resistance movement, with some even claiming that Werwolf attacks continued for months, or even years, after the end of the war\u2014-in particular, sources cited by West Coast radio broadcaster Dave Emory, for instance in this archived program on audio, following a brief first segment.

Prime Mini", "The bar jack is a moderately large species, growing to a recorded maximum length of 69\u00a0cm, and a weight of 6.8\u00a0kg, but is commonly encountered at lengths of less than 40\u00a0cm. The bar jack displays the typical body shape of most of the jacks, having an elongate, moderately deep and compressed form, with dorsal and ventral profiles of approximately equal convexity. The dorsal fin is divided into two sections, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second has 1 spine followed by 26 to 30 soft rays. The anal fin is composed of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 23 to 26 soft rays, with both the anal and soft dorsal fin lobes being slightly elongated. The pectoral fins are falcate and longer than the head, consisting of 19 to 21 soft rays. The lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, and possesses 17 to 104 scales including 23 to 29 scutes posteriorly; also having bilateral paired caudal keels present. The chest is completely scaled, which easily distinguishes it from the similar crevalle jack, Caranx hippos. The snout is moderately pointed, with both the jaws containing narrow bands of villiform teeth, with the bands becoming wider anteriorly. The upper jaw also contains an outer row of enlarged recurved teeth. There are 10 to 14 upper limb gill rakers, and 31 to 38 on the lower limb and 24 vertebrae.\nThe bar jack has a gray to grayish blue upper body with a silvery tint, which fades ventrally to a white belly. As indicated by their common name, adult bar jack have a horizontal stripe running along their back and through the lower lobe of the caudal fin. This bar is a golden brownish to blackish color, often with an electric blue bar running parallel immediately underneath it. All other fins are pale dusky to hyaline. Juveniles have up to 6 dark bands on their body and a darker lower caudal lobe than the upper lobe, foreshadowing the bar that develops at a later stage. At these early stages, they are difficult to distinguish from Carangoides bartholomaei, with the best identifier being gill raker counts. The entire body has been observed to change colour to a blackish colour when the fish is feeding near the bottom.", "Religious images in Christian theology have a role within the liturgical and devotional life of adherents of certain Christian denominations. The use of religious images has often been a contentious issue in Christian history.  Concern over idolatry is the driving force behind the various traditions of aniconism in Christianity. \nIn the early Church, Christians used the Ichthys (fish) symbol to identify Christian places of worship and Christian homes. The Synod of Elvira (306 AD - 312 AD) \"prohibited the exhibition of images in churches\". However, since the 3rd century AD, images have been used within Christian worship within parts of Christendom, although some ancient Churches, such as the Church of the East, have apparently long traditions of not using images. \nCertain periods of Christian history have seen supporters of aniconism in Christianity, first with the movement of Byzantine Iconoclasm, in which Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Emperors Michael II, as well as Theophilos, \"banned veneration of icons and actively persecuted supporters of icons.\" Later, during the Iconoclastic Fury, Calvinists removed statues and sacred art from churches that adopted the Reformed faith.\nReligious imagery today, in the form of statues, is most identified with the Roman Catholic and Lutheran traditions. Icons are used extensively, and are most often associated with parts of Eastern Christianity, although they are also used by Roman Catholics and Lutherans. Since the 1800s, devotional art has become very common in Christian homes, both Protestant and Catholic, often including wall crosses, embroidered verses from the Christian Bible, as well as imagery of Jesus. In Western Christianity, it is common for believers to have a home altar, while dwelling places belonging to communicants of the Eastern Christian Churches often have an icon corner.\nA cult image or idol is a material object, representing a deity, to which religious worship is directed. It is also controversially and pejoratively used by some Protestants to describe the Eastern Orthodox (and, to a lesser extent, Catholic) practice of worshipping the Christian God through the use of icons, a charge which these Christians reject. In a similarly controversial sense, it is also used by some Protestants to pejoratively describe various Catholic devotional practices such as scapulars and the veneration of statues and flat images of the Virgin Mary and other saints, which Catholics do not consider idolatry.", "The list of fish in Ukraine consists of indigenous, and also introduced species.\nThese tags are used to evaluate the conservation status of species by criteria of IUCN:\nAll the listed species are classified by their origin as freshwater, brackishwater, marine, anadromous, catadromous, and euryhaline; also classified as native, introduced, invasive, and species with accidental finding (difficult to characterize it as native or invasive).", "Henry Stone (1616 \u2013 24 Aug 1653), known as \"Old Stone\", was an English painter and copyist of the works of Van Dyck.\nHenry was the eldest son of notable sculptor and architect Nicholas Stone (1586/7-1647); his brothers Nicholas Stone Jr. (1618\u20131647) and John Stone (1620\u201367) were sculptors and masons. Henry went to Holland, where he was apprenticed to his uncle, the painter Thomas de Keyser. He later went on a tour of the continent with his brother Nicholas Jr. visiting France, and Italy to study art, and returned in 1642. After his father's death he and his youngest brother John carried on their father's business of masonry and statuary.\nStone was, however, chiefly known as a portrait painter, and was an excellent copyist of the works of Van Dyck and the Italian Masters. He also published a short work on painting, called \"The Third Part of the Art of Painting\".\nStone inherited his father's house and workyard in Long Acre, London and died there on 24 August 1653. He was buried on 27 August near his father in St. Martin's Church, and on his inscription it is stated that he had passed the greatest part of thirty-seven years in Holland, France, and Italy. He is usually known as \u2018Old Stone\u2019 to distinguish him from his younger brothers.\nHenry's Stone's portrait was painted by Sir Peter Lely.", "Serial numbers can be very useful for quality control. That way, if there is a problem with a certain batch of products, the serial number of one defective item can tell which items are affected by the problem. Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products, because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used. Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily.\nMany computer programs come with serial numbers, often called \"Compact Disc keys\", and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue. These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys. \nSerial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency, because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number. \nThe International Standard Serial Number or ISSN  can be seen on magazines and other periodicals. It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for books.  It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical, like a newspaper.\nCertificates and Certificate Authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic \nThe term \"serial number\" is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression \"service number\". In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft. It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft's fin/rudder(s).  Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a \"tail number\".\nIn the case of the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the \"Serial\" takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers, e.g., BT308\u2014the prototype Avro Lancaster, or XS903\u2014an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook . During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had \"/G\" added to the end of the serial, the \"G\" signifying \"Guard\", denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., LZ548/G\u2014the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or ML926/G\u2014a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this two-letter, three-number scheme, the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps (RFC) used a serial with a letter followed by four numbers, e.g., D8096 - a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or K5054 - the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The aircraft serial number does not change.", "In 1851, Benjamin Conquest acquired the Grecian Theatre and Eagle Tavern in the City Road, Hackney, London. The theatre had previously produced light opera and was originally a music hall, but Conquest senior switched to Shakespeare which was unsuccessful.

George was also an acrobat and pantomimist and produced and appeared in nearly 50 pantomimes with Henry Spry.\nGeorge helped to run the Grecian and inherited it on his father's death. The theatre was rebuilt in 1858, again in 1876, and sold in around 1878 or 1879 when George Conquest went on a tour of the United States. He was injured in a stage accident during the tour. He returned to England and took over the Surrey Theatre in Lambeth in 1881, staging melodramas and pantomimes as he had at the Grecian.

The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer, doing penance, mortifying the flesh, repentance of sins, almsgiving, and self-denial. This event is observed in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, Oriental Orthodox, Reformed, and Roman Catholic Churches. Some Anabaptist and evangelical churches also observe the Lenten season. \nThe last week of Lent is Holy Week, starting with Palm Sunday. Following the New Testament story, Jesus' crucifixion is commemorated on Good Friday, and at the beginning of the next week the joyful celebration of Easter Sunday recalls the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nIn Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the account of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ's journey into the desert for 40 days; this is known as one's Lenten sacrifice. Many Christians also add a Lenten spiritual discipline, such as reading a daily devotional or praying through a Lenten calendar, to draw themselves near to God. The Stations of the Cross, a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and of his execution, are often observed. Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes, religious statues, and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event. Throughout Christendom, some adherents mark the season with the traditional abstention from the consumption of meat, most notably among Lutherans, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.\nLent is traditionally described as lasting for 40 days, in commemoration of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert, according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, before beginning his public ministry, during which he endured temptation by Satan. Depending on the Christian denomination and local custom, Lent ends either on the evening of Maundy Thursday, or at sundown on Holy Saturday, when the Easter Vigil is celebrated. Regardless, Lenten practices are properly maintained until the evening of Holy Saturday.", "The Hungarian tribes originated in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains, arrived in the territory formed by present-day Romania during the 9th century from Etelk\u00f6z or Atelkuzu (roughly the space occupied by the present day Southern Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and the Romanian province of Moldavia). Due to various circumstances (see Honfoglal\u00e1s), the Magyar tribes crossed the Carpathians around 895 AD and occupied the Carpathian Basin (including present-day Transylvania) without significant resistance from the local populace. The precise date of the conquest of Transylvania is not known; the earliest Magyar artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century.\nIn 1526, at the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, the forces of the Ottoman Empire annihilated the Hungarian army and in 1571 Transylvania became an autonomous state, under the Ottoman suzerainty. The Principality of Transylvania was governed by its princes and its parliament (Diet). The Transylvanian Diet consisted of three Estates (Unio Trium Nationum): the Hungarian nobility (largely ethnic Hungarian nobility and clergy); the leaders of Transylvanian Saxons-German burghers; and the free Sz\u00e9kely Hungarians.\nWith the defeat of the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Habsburg Monarchy gradually began to impose their rule on the formerly autonomous Transylvania. From 1711 onward, after the conclusion of R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence, Habsburg control over Transylvania was consolidated, and the princes of Transylvania were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors. In 1765 the Grand Principality of Transylvania was proclaimed, consolidating the special separate status of Transylvania within the Habsburg Empire, established by the Diploma Leopoldinum in 1691. The Hungarian historiography sees this as a mere formality. Within the Habsburg Empire, Transylvania was administratively part of Kingdom of Hungary.\nAfter quashing the 1848 revolution, the Habsburg Empire imposed a repressive regime on Hungary and ruled Transylvania directly through a military governor. Habsburgs abolished the Unio Trium Nationum and granted citizenship to ethnic Romanians. However, in the compromise of 1867, which established the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the special status of Transylvania ended and it became a province under the control of the Kingdom of Hungary. Hungarian becomes the official language and a policy of Magyarization was applied to the various ethnic groups in Transylvania.\nFollowing defeat in World War I, Austria-Hungary disintegrated. The ethnic Romanian majority in Transylvania elected representatives, who then proclaimed Union with Romania on 1 December 1918.\nWith the conclusion of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles, formally signed in June 1919, recognized the sovereignty of Kingdom of Romania over Transylvania as a historic fact. The Treaties of St. Germain (1919) and Trianon (signed on June 1920) further elaborated the status of Transylvania and defined the new border between the states of Hungary and Romania. As a result, the more than 1.5 million Hungarian minority of Transylvania found itself becoming a minority group within Romania.\nIn August 1940, during the Second World War, the northern half of Transylvania was annexed to Hungary by the second Second Vienna Award. Historian Keith Hitchins summarizes the situation created by the award: Some 1,150,000 to 1,300,000 Romanians, or 48 per cent to over 50 per cent of the population of the ceded territory, depending upon whose statistics are used, remained north of the new frontier, while about 500,000 Hungarians (other Hungarian estimates go as high as 800,000, Romanian as low as 363,000) continued to reside in the south.\nThe Treaty of Paris (1947) after the end of the Second World War overturned the Vienna Award, and the territory of northern Transylvania was returned to Romania. The post-World War II borders with Hungary agreed on at the Treaty of Paris were identical with those set out in 1920.\nAfter the war, in 1952, a Magyar Autonomous Region was created in Romania by the communist authorities", "Mutsu-Sawabe Station (\u9678\u5965\u6ca2\u8fba\u99c5, Mutsu-Sawabe-eki) is a railway station located in the town of Fukaura, Aomori Prefecture Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East).", "GCR = Geological Conservation Review\nLNR = Local Nature Reserve\n \nNCR = Nature Conservation Review\nNNR = National Nature Reserve\nNT = National Trust\nRamsar = Ramsar site, an internationally important wetland site\nSM = Scheduled Monument\nSPA = Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds\nSSSI = Site of Special Scientific Interest", "Kerak Castle is an example of one of the first castles built by the Franks that used a fortified tower structure and is a notable example of Crusader architecture, a mixture of west European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. Many early Frankish castles that predate Kerak were merely towers built along the crusader states during the early years of crusading. In the second half of the twelfth century, the growing Muslim threat made crusaders update their castle design and prioritize defensive elements. Kerak Castle is a prime example of a spur castle, a castle built on top of a mountain to take advantage of the natural topography, as it is built on the southern end of a plateau surrounded on three sides by steep hills. This had the advantage during a siege of concentrating an attack on only one side of the castle, so the defenders could locate most of their manpower there. Spur castles also took advantage of \"glacis,\" a sloping hill that exposed attackers to the defenders. The steep hills around Kerak are characteristic of a glacis.\nA chapel was built on the east side of the castle, about half-way along the length of the curtain wall. The castle also used man-made fortifications, including ditches and thick stone walls. Because Muslim armies started to move with siege weapons such as siege engines, Frankish castles started adapting by building thicker and more solid walls. A \"Byzantine ditch\", a ditch to keep siege engines at a safer distance, was constructed near the castle. There is another ditch near the town which is much deeper but less wide, to the West of the castle (now almost completely filled-in). The crusaders used rough-shaped volcanic stone to build large walls around the perimeter of the castle. After Sa'd al-Din captured Kerak, the Muslims used limestone from nearby quarries to repair and expand the castle. Both the Muslim and Christian stonework show signs of draft masonry, stone blocks which are smooth on the edges, but the centre portion is left rough and raised.\nThe castle walls are strengthened with rectangular projecting towers, pointing to the fact that it was one of the earlier castles constructed by crusaders, it was only later on in the crusades that the transition to round towers in the curtain wall was made to help with visibility. At Kerak, the towers are much closer together than at other castles, theoretically to help with visibility problems. The towers were also placed at regular points along the wall; this is called the Byzantine tower structure\u2014the square towers at Kerak are identical to the ones used by the Byzantine empire.\nWhile Kerak Castle is a large and strong castle, its design is less sophisticated than that of concentric crusader castles like Krak des Chevaliers, and its masonry is comparatively crude. Many of its defenses were destroyed and rebuilt during its conquest by the Ayyubid and Mamluk Dynasties. Under An-Nasir Dawud, much of the defenses of Kerak were expanded and improved in 1244-45. In 1227, the Sultan of Damascus al-Mu'azzam 'Isa, commissioned the construction of a tunnel that ran from the castle into the town.", "Barwon River, a perennial river that is part of the Murray\u2013Darling basin, is located in the north-west slopes and  Orana regions of New South Wales, Australia.\nThe name \"barwon\" is derived from the Australian Aboriginal words of barwum or bawon, meaning great, wide, awful river of muddy water; and also baawan, a Ngiyambaa name for both the Barwon and Darling rivers.

As late as 1940, the population of Filipinos in the Territory of Hawaii outnumbered Filipinos in the continental United States. In 1970, the Honolulu metropolitan area alone had a population of 66,653 Filipinos, the largest Filipino population in any metropolitan area in the United States.\nAccording to the 2000 Census, the state of Hawaii had a Filipino population of over 275,000, with over 191,000 living on the island of Oahu; of those, 102,000 were immigrants.

A distinctive feature of a violin body is its hourglass-like shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the waist, providing clearance for the bow. The \"voice\" or sound of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the thickness profile) of both the top and back, the varnish that coats its outside surface and the skill of the luthier in doing all of these steps. The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age, making the fixed supply of old well-made violins built by famous luthiers much sought-after.\nThe majority of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue for a number of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running around the edge of the spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on faux purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.\nThe neck is usually maple with a flamed figure compatible with that of the ribs and back. It carries the fingerboard, typically made of ebony, but often some other wood stained or painted black on cheaper instruments. Ebony is the preferred material because of its hardness, beauty, and superior resistance to wear. Fingerboards are dressed to a particular transverse curve, and have a small lengthwise \"scoop,\" or concavity, slightly more pronounced on the lower strings, especially when meant for gut or synthetic strings. Some old violins (and some made to appear old) have a grafted scroll, evidenced by a glue joint between the pegbox and neck. Many authentic old instruments have had their necks reset to a slightly increased angle, and lengthened by about a centimeter. The neck graft allows the original scroll to be kept with a Baroque violin when bringing its neck into conformance with modern standards.\nThe bridge is a precisely cut piece of maple that forms the lower anchor point of the vibrating length of the strings and transmits the vibration of the strings to the body of the instrument. Its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard in an arc, allowing each to be sounded separately by the bow. The sound post, or soul post, fits precisely inside the instrument between the back and top, at a carefully chosen spot near the treble foot of the bridge, which it helps support. It also influences the modes of vibration of the top and the back of the instrument.\nThe tailpiece anchors the strings to the lower bout of the violin by means of the tailgut, which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin (sometimes confusingly called the endpin, like the cello's spike), which fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block. Very often the E string will have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, especially on a student instrument, and are sometimes bu", "Historically Mirdita was the largest tribal region of Albania in terms of geographic spread and population.

It was not catalogued by Bayer with a Greek letter, but was listed by Flamsteed as number 9 in the constellation Sagittarius.  It lies close to the open cluster NGC 6530.  9 Sgr is the main source of ionisation for much of the visible nebulosity in the region, although the young O star Herschel 36 ionises the dense Hourglass Nebula region.\n9 Sgr itself is surrounded by an ionised HII region about 30 light years across including the reflection nebulae NGC 6523 and NGC 6533.  This ionised region lies in front of a denser molecular cloud.\nThe distances to 9 Sgr, M8, and NGC 6530 are uncertain, but generally estimated to be between 1,200 and 1,800 parsecs.  Recent studies derive a distance around 1,250 pc for the M8 region.  Erosion of the front of the molecular cloud apparently caused by 9 Sgr suggests that it lies in front of the cloud, but studies of 9 Sgr as a binary star give a distance of 1,790 pc.", "Some of the main events in Newton's history are listed in the table below, in date order.

Forewing: no discocellular black spot so conspicuous as in T. theophrastus; terminal margin with a narrow edging of fuscous black, widest at the apex, gradually decreasing to the tornus, followed by an inconspicuous anteciliary jet-black line. Hindwing: costal margin slightly but broadly shaded with fuscous, which is continued as a slender anteciliary black line to the tornus. Underside: white. Forewing: with the following brownish-black markings: an irregular edging along the costa to near the apex from which extends downwards a subbasal band, broadened across the cell and below it; an irregular band that extends along the discocellulars and below them to interspace 1 where it ends in a point; an upper discal curved band of more even width but dislocated below vein 4, the lower portion of it shifted inwards forms a large quadrate spot in interspace 3, below vein 3 the band is continued downwards by two small inconspicuous spots, beyond this is a very short acutely pointed comma-shaped mark; a very regular evenly curved complete transverse lunular line, a transverse series of subterminal spots and an anteciliary slender line. Close to the base of the wing extended obliquely upwards and outwards from the dorsum is a triangular mark, the edging of white colour left near the base forms above the apex of this mark an acute angle; between the band that crosses the middle of the cell and the transverse discocellular band is a more or less slender, irregular, similarly coloured line; and between the discocellular and upper discal bands another much shorter line that extends from the costa downwards but does not reach vein 4, this is slightly clavate anteriorly and posteriorly.

In 331 BC, after the return of Alexander from Egypt, Nicocreon visited the city of Tyre to pay homage to him, where he distinguished himself by the magnificence which he displayed in furnishing his theatrical exhibitions. \nAfter the death of Alexander, Nicocreon allied with Ptolemy against Antigonus, and in 315 BC, he colluded with Seleucus and Menelaus, two of Ptolemy's generals, in neutralizing the Cypriot city-kingdoms which had supported Antigonus. In return for these services, Ptolemy awarded him personal command of Citium, Lapithos, Keryneia, and Marion, in addition to retaining Salamis.  He was also entrusted with the chief command over the whole island of Cyprus. \nNothing is known of the fortunes of Nicocreon after this. As there is no mention of his name during the memorable siege of Salamis by Demetrius Poliorcetes (306 BC), or the great sea-fight that followed it, it seems probable that he must have died before those events.

He, along with King Dhammazedi (r. 1471\u20131492), is considered one of the two most important kings of the Martaban\u2013Hanthawaddy dynasty. His main achievements were unifying much of Lower Burma for the first time, and defending the territorial integrity of his unified kingdom from Ava's attacks, earning him the moniker \"Yazadarit the Unifier\".\nBut his unification was not just due to his much chronicled military skills alone. He invested much energy on integrating hitherto factious centers of power\u2014in particular, Martaban, Moulmein, Bassein and Myaungmya\u2014into a more centralized administration, which on balance were generally successful. Aung-Thwin writes: \"it took incredible discipline, military skill and political will to do it [unify the kingdom], leaving his successors, particularly Shin Saw Bu and Dhammazedi, with a kingdom that was far less fractious, reasonably well integrated and wealthy.\" Without him, \"the dynasty probably would not have survived much beyond Binnya U.\"\nHe was certainly held in high regard by his successors. Three of his children\u2014Binnya Dhammaraza (r. 1421\u20131424), Binnya Ran I (r. 1424\u20131446) and Shin Saw Pu (r. 1454\u20131471) became monarchs of Hanthawaddy Pegu.

This same tenure saw several other economies stagnating or falling due to the effects of GST implementation and currency demonetisation. This was especially surprising as Kerala faced multiple major natural disasters such as floods and cyclone Okhi combined with virus outbreaks such as nipah and COV\u0130D 19 . \nThis period with Dr T. M. Thomas Isaac as the finance minister saw fiscal deficit decreasing steadily accompanied with GDP increase . Furthermore growth of industries showed a record increase from 3.7% in 2018 to 11.2% in 2019 . \nOne of the flagship projects of the state government , Kerala Startup Mission saw fruit as Kerala ranked 1st for startup ranking .\nPer capita GDP of Kerala is \u20b9225,484 (US$3,200) which makes it 6th in India . The difference between the state's rank in GDP and per capita GDP highlights the lack of wealth gap in the state. \nKerala's high GDP and productivity figures with higher development figures is often dubbed the \"Kerala Phenomenon\" or the \"Kerala Model\" of development by economists, political scientists, and sociologists. This phenomenon arises mainly from Kerala's land reforms, social upliftment of entire communities initiated from the first democratic government of Kerala led by E. M. S. Namboodiripad and subsequently implemented by various governments ruled the state. Some describe Kerala's economy as a \"democratic socialist welfare state\". Some, such as Financial Express, use the term \"Money Order Economy\". Estimates of the 2013 Tendulkar Committee Report on poverty suggest that percentages of population below poverty line in rural and urban Kerala are 9.14% and 4.97%\nKerala, accounts for 2.8% of India's population, but its economy contributes nearly 4% to the Indian economy. Thus, the southern state's per capita income is 60% higher than India's average. This has fuelled internal migration to Kerala for low-end jobs, even as Keralites have emigrated\u2014mostly to the Gulf countries\u2014in search of better-paying jobs. Around 3,000,000 Keralites are working abroad, mainly in Persian Gulf; to where migration started with the Gulf Boom. The Kerala Economy is therefore largely dependent on trade in services and resulted remittances. In 2012, the state was the highest receiver of overall remittances to India which stood at Rs. 49,965 Crore (31.2% of the State's GDP), followed by Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. S. Irudaya Rajan describes the situation as \"Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy\". With 11.8% of the labour force unemployed in 2015, Kerala is 11th in unemployment in India. Underemployment, low employability of youths, and a 13.5% female participation rate are chronic issues. The 'Report on Fifth Annual Employment - Unemployment Survey for 2015-16' prepared by the labour bureau of the Union ministry of labour and employment indicates that Tripura had the highest unemployment rate of 19.7%  in India, followed by Sikkim (18.1%) and Kerala (12.5%).", "Himeji Castle contains advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. Loopholes (\u72ed\u9593, sama) in the shape of circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles are located throughout Himeji Castle, intended to allow defenders armed with tanegashima or archers to fire on attackers without exposing themselves. Roughly 1,000 loopholes exist in the castle buildings remaining today. Angled chutes called \"stone drop windows\" (\u77f3\u843d\u7a93, ishi-otoshi-mado) were also set at numerous points in the castle walls, enabling stones or boiling oil to be poured on the heads of attackers passing by underneath, and white plaster was used in the castle's construction for its resistance to fire.\nThe castle complex included three moats, one of which\u2014the outer moat\u2014is now buried. Parts of the central moat and all of the inner moats survive. The moats have an average width of 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft), a maximum width of 34.5\u00a0m (113\u00a0ft), and a depth of about 2.7\u00a0m (8.9\u00a0ft). The Three Country Moat (\u4e09\u56fd\u5800, sangoku-bori) is a 2,500\u00a0m\u00b2 (27,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) pond which exists inside the castle; one of the purposes of this moat was to store water for use in fire prevention.\nThe castle complex, particularly the Waist Quarter (\u8170\u66f2\u8f2a, koshikuruwa), contains numerous warehouses that were used to store rice, salt and water in case of a siege. A building known as the Salt Turret (\u5869\u6ad3, shioyagura)  was used specifically to store salt, and it is estimated that it contained as many as 3,000 bags of salt when the castle complex was in use. The castle complex also contained 33 wells within the inner moat, 13 of which remain; the deepest of these has a depth of 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).\nOne of the castle's most important defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths leading to the castle's keep. The gates, baileys, and outer walls of the complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force, causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex on its way to the keep. The castle complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according to the Japanese syllabary iroha (I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To, etc.). At present, 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according to the Japanese syllabary.\nIn many cases, the castle walkways even turn back on themselves, greatly inhibiting navigation. For example, the straight distance from the Hishi Gate (\u83f1\u306e\u9580, hishinomon) to the main keep (\u5927\u5929\u5b88, daitenshu) is only 130\u00a0m (430\u00a0ft), but the path itself is a much longer 325\u00a0m (1,066\u00a0ft). The passages are also steep and narrow, further inhibiting entry. This system allowed the intruders to be watched and fired upon from the keep during their lengthy approach, but Himeji Castle was never attacked in this manner so the system remains untested. However, even today with the route clearly marked, many visitors have trouble navigating the castle complex.", "Gunther Jaeckel is a famous New York City furrier.

The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a tesseract (or the cells of a 16-cell respectively).\nFor higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find \"symmetrical figures...elegant in themselves,\" that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an elegant four-set diagram using ellipses (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for any number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.", "The metabolism of carbophenothion in human beings, is comparable to the metabolism in mice, insects and plants. There is little data of the quantitative degradation of carbophenothion to oxidative and hydrolytic compounds in mammals. It was found that in the rat more than 75% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours. Carbophenothion is therefore estimated to be rapidly excreted in humans as well. The compound is most toxic when it is not metabolized. The acute toxicity of the majority of the metabolites of carbophenothion have been studied in rats. They are considerably less toxic and thus show that metabolism of carbophenothion does probably not involve bioactivation but rather detoxification. The two main products of this metabolism are sulphoxide and sulphone. Five oxidative products have been identified: the oxygen analogue of the carbophenothion, the sulphoxide and its oxygen analogue and finally sulphones and its oxygen analogue, all of which are depicted on the right.\nThe first major route of degradation of carbophenothion in rats is sulfoxidation, as displayed on the right. This product can be further transformed into 4-chlorobenzenesulphinic and 4-chlorobenzenesulphonic acid. A second major route involves the formation of 4-chlorothiophenol, which is further transformed via methylation and ring-hydroxylation to 4-Chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl methyl sulfone. This is then converted in approximately equal proportions to sulphate and glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, there are metabolites that presumably arise from the cleavage of the P-S bond such as 4-chlorophenylsulphinylmethyl methyl sulphone.  An overview of the metabolites and their occurrence as has been studied in rats can be found in the table below.\nOne study on rats found that during 48 hours 66% of the administered carbophenothion was excreted in the urine and according to other experiments it takes approximately six days before complete excretion was achieved. Other studies say that even after 14 days there was a detectable level of the oxidation product present.", "Mires, although perhaps at their greatest extent at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, are found around the globe. Estimating the extent of mire land cover worldwide is difficult due to the varying accuracy and methodologies of land surveys from many countries. However, mires occur wherever conditions are right for peat accumulation: largely where organic matter is constantly waterlogged. The distribution of mires therefore depends on topography, climate, parent material, biota and time. The type of mire - bog, fen or swamp - depends also on each of these factors.\nThe largest accumulations of mires, constituting around 64% of global peatlands, are found in the temperate, boreal and subarctic zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In polar regions, mires are usually shallow, because of the slow rate of accumulation of dead organic matter, and often contain permafrost. Very large swathes of Canada, northern Europe and northern Russia are covered by boreal mires. In temperate areas mires are typically more scattered due to historical drainage and peat extraction, but can cover large areas. One example is blanket bog where precipitation is very high (e.g. in maritime climates inland near the coasts of the north-east and south Pacific, and the north-west and north-east Atlantic). In the sub-tropics, mires are rare and restricted to the wettest areas.\nIn the tropics, mires can again be extensive, typically underlying tropical rainforest (for example, in Kalimantan), although tropical peat formation occurs in coastal mangroves, as well as in areas of high altitude. Tropical mires largely form where high precipitation is combined with poor conditions for drainage. Tropical mires account for around 11% of peatlands globally (more than half of which can be found in Southeast Asia), and are most commonly found at low altitudes, although they can also be found in mountainous regions, for example in South America, Africa and Papua New Guinea. Recently, the world's largest tropical mire was found in the Central Congo Basin, covering 145,500 square kilometres and may store up to 30 petagrams of Carbon.\nMires have declined globally due to drainage for agriculture and forestry, and for peat harvesting. For example, more than 50% of original European mire area, more than 300000\u00a0km\u00b2, has been lost. Some of the largest losses have been in Russia, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland and Belarus.", "On 9 March, using the misreported atrocities as justification, Gustav Noske decreed:\n\"The brutality and bestiality of the Spartacists who fight against us compel me to give the following order: any person who is caught with arms in his hands in the struggle against the government will be shot on the spot.\"\nThe military took the order further, ordering the shooting of anyone caught with weapons in their homes. Firearms searches commenced at random resulting in numerous summary executions, including against those uninvolved in the strike. The Freikorps indiscriminately attacked residential buildings under the claim that they had been shot at, leaving entire areas in complete ruin from artillery and aerial bombs. Residents fled to their cellars but supported the insurgents by providing food and drink. On 11 March, 29 sailors of the Volksmarinedivision were murdered with machine guns when they went to surrender and collect their discharge pay. The sailors were picked out of several hundred prisoners because they \"looked intelligent\". Colonel Reinhard had ordered the shooting allegedly because the prisons were overcrowded.\nThe conservative mayor of Lichtenberg, Oskar Ziethen, sought a truce between Noske and the insurgents to avoid further bloodshed. These advances were rejected, as Noske insisted on \"unconditional surrender or nothing\". The last barricade fell on 12 March. By 13 March the fighting had almost completely ended, although the shooting order would not be lifted until 16 March.\nEstimates of death tolls range from 1,200 to 3,000, with small losses for government forces. Among those killed was KPD leader Leo Jogiches on 10 March, who was shot while allegedly trying to escape from the police.

They play in the southern division of the National Football Conference (NFC), one of the two conferences of the National Football League (NFL). Since the team began play in 1995, there have been four head coaches. In the NFL, head coaches are responsible for managing the team and setting the game plan; play-calling duties are either made by the head coach or delegated by him to an assistant coach.\nThe team's first head coach, Dom Capers, led the team for its first four seasons, recording a regular-season record of 30\u201334 (.469 winning percentage). in 1996. Capers was named coach of the year by Pro Football Weekly/PFWA in 1995 and 1996; he was also awarded coach of the year by several other organizations in 1996, including the Associated Press, the Maxwell Football Club, Sporting News, and United Press International.

These are both silica minerals, but they differ in that quartz has a trigonal crystal structure, while moganite is monoclinic. Chalcedony's standard chemical structure (based on the chemical structure of quartz) is SiO\u2082 (silicon dioxide).\nChalcedony has a waxy luster, and may be semitransparent or translucent.  It can assume a wide range of colors, but those most commonly seen are white to gray, grayish-blue or a shade of brown ranging from pale to nearly black.  The color of chalcedony sold commercially is often enhanced by dyeing or heating.\nThe name chalcedony comes from the Latin chalcedonius (alternatively spelled calchedonius). The name appears in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia as a term for a translucid kind of Jaspis.  The name is probably derived from the town Chalcedon in Asia Minor.

The plaque reads: \n\"Salt was an important commodity to early settlers because of its use in daily living. In 1814 Silas Thorla and Robert McKee dug a well in search of salt brine.  They discovered salt, and by accident, discovered oil.  Oil's value was unknown to them so they had to separate the oil from the salt water by soaking the oil up from the surface with blankets.  The oil was wrung from the blankets, bottled as \"Seneca Oil,\" and sold as a \"cure all.\" The remaining brine was boiled down to extract the salt.\"\nAfter the Thorla-McKee well, other wells drilled for salt brine in Kentucky and West Virginia also produced oil and gas as byproducts.  The Drake Well, drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, is generally recognized as the first well in the United States drilled for oil itself.", "In the United States, the 4-8-0 was essentially a freight locomotive that was a development of the 2-8-0 Consolidation. Most American 4-8-0 locomotives were built in the late 19th or early 20th century. The type never achieved great popularity, although there were five occasions when a 4-8-0 locomotive was considered as the heaviest and/or most powerful in the world upon its introduction. Those locomotives were the no. 20 Champion of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1880, the no. 229 Mastodon of the Central Pacific Railroad in 1882, the G5 class of the Great Northern Railway in 1897 and the no. 640 of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1899. It is noteworthy that the Great Northern G5 had 16-inch-diameter (410\u00a0mm) piston valves, as large as the pistons of many locomotives then in service.\nFinally, the Duluth and Iron Range Railway ordered a number of trim-lined Mastodons, beginning in 1893, which were reportedly the heaviest freight engines constructed at the time. They had long, between-the-drivers fireboxes and a relatively short stroke for freight engines of the era. They were numbered from 60 to 89 and became the railroad's class J.  After 1900, they were gradually phased out in favor of the more conventional Consolidation type. All were scrapped by 1933.\nEven though, at the time, the wide-firebox 2-8-2 Mikado had much more potential as far as speed is concerned, the Norfolk and Western Railway opted for the class M 4-8-0 for its shorter wheelbase that enabled it to have over 90 percent of the locomotive's weight on the driving wheels, and the four-wheel leading truck for greater stability. The N&W operated 4-8-0s from the early 1900s to the late 1950s. Built by Baldwin Locomotive Works from 1906 and nicknamed Mollies, the class M, class M1 and class M2 became the most numerous American class of 4-8-0.\nThe class M2 locomotives are often mistakenly believed to be the largest conventional 4-8-0s built, but the Mexican PR-8 was over four tons heavier. Many of them lasted into the 1950s, but were poor steamers since the boiler's heating surface had been significantly increased compared to the classes M and M1, but with no corresponding improvement of firebox volume and grate area.\nA single 4-8-0 continues to operate in the United States in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. The locomotive is the Norfolk and Western 4-8-0 no. 475, operating on the Strasburg Rail Road.", "A guardian angel is a type of angel that is assigned to protect and guide a particular person, group or nation. Belief in tutelary beings can be traced throughout all antiquity. The idea of angels that guard over people played a major role in Ancient Judaism. In Christianity, the hierarchy of angels was extensively developed in the 5th century by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The theology of angels and tutelary spirits has undergone many changes since the 5th century. Belief in both the East and the West is that guardian angels serve to protect whichever person God assigns them to, and present prayer to God on that person's behalf.", "In the eyes of conservatives Taviani\u2019s contribution to the Italian Constitution and his book La Propriet\u00e0 made him appear to be too close to socialist ideas. But during the first years of the cold war Taviani was one of the firmest supporters of NATO which he viewed as the only possible guarantee of Italy\u2019s security. This position drew criticism from socialists and communists.\nIn the early 1960s Taviani favoured an alliance between the Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party in the regional government of Liguria which he later supported for years in national governments. In 1964 he firmly refused to accept a proposal by Italy\u2019s President Antonio Segni to head an emergency government as an authoritarian crack down on the communists.

The first male patient was admitted in 1860.  It was originally known as the 'Michigan Asylum for the Insane' and was renamed the 'Kalamazoo State Hospital' in 1911.  Its name was changed to the 'Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital' on 1 January 1978 and in July 1995 it assumed its present designation, the 'Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital'.  Many local residents commonly refer to it simply as the 'State Hospital'.\nThe facility has continuously expanded and now stretches almost 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) along Oakland Drive, which was originally known as Asylum Avenue.  It is bounded by Howard Street on the south, and by the campus of Western Michigan University on the north. Almost all the original and historic buildings have been demolished and new, modern ones have been built in their place. This includes the original hospital building, which originally was covered with vines and had a more pleasant appearance.\nThe water tower was designed by B.F. Stratton and was constructed in 1895 by contractor Benjamin Roe. It quickly became a local landmark and played prominently in the history of the city. In time, two working farms were opened for the care and rehabilitation of patients and were located about 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) to the north and south of the main campus. Later, a former state tuberculosis sanatorium on Blakeslee was taken over by the hospital and utilized for the treatment and care of elderly patients.\nAnother landmark on the main campus is the 'gate cottage' situated near Oakland Drive at the entrance to the hospital grounds. The gatehouse is  'carpenter gothic' in style, featuring board and batten siding, a steep roof and 'gingerbread' ornamentation.

There is a distinctive greeting ceremony between pair members, where they spread their wings and tails and give a harsh call. The same motions are used as a breeding display, but with a non-ritualized duet call. Since males and females are identical, birds recognize members of the opposite sex not by size or color but by behavioral differences. Males are more aggressive and are more frequent singers.:34 Mating displays begin with a growl-like noise, and end in gentle pecking. Displays are much shorter than in most bird species, lasting only two to three seconds.:35 Mating season begins in late February and runs through March.\nNests are built in cacti (commonly cholla, prickly pear, and saguaro), thorny desert trees, or yucca. Where available, jumping cholla is overwhelmingly preferred.:22 Nests average about 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) off the ground, and are usually less than 3.0\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) off the ground, but have been recorded as high as 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft). Nests are prolate spheroidal-shaped\u00a0\u2013 the size and shape of an American football or rugby ball\u00a0\u2013  when possible, and are pouchlike in nature. The exact shape and size of nests varies depending on the surroundings; nests are generally loose, bulky and globose, and adapted to fit the nest site. The exterior is constructed of grass, twigs, feathers, weeds and other light detritus, while it is lined with feathers and down\u00a0\u2013 which may come from cactus wrens or other species. Nests built in urban settings use a much wider variety of materials, including many human made items such as paper, string, and lint. Chicken feathers are also used as nest lining in great quantities where available.:24 Urban materials, while easily available, make for weaker and less sturdy nests.:28 A tubelike entrance, about 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) long, leads to the main nest cavity. The entrance is often oriented to take advantage of the cooling effects of prevailing winds. Nest building takes between one and six days, with Anderson and Anderson reporting an average time of 2.7 days.:26 The nesting pair usually focuses on nest building only for the first three hours of each morning.\nMultiple nests are often built. The first nest of a season may use an existing nest that has been renovated; subsequent nests will usually be built from scratch. Adult roosting nests are not usually used as breeding nests, and are less sturdily constructed. While the female lays a clutch in one nest, the male will start to build a second. As soon as the first brood fledges the female will assist in additional nest building. Once completed a new clutch will be laid. Up to six broods may be attempted in a year, but it is rare for more than three to survive. One or two broods is more typical.\nEgg laying occurs no sooner than 18 days after copulation, with March being the height of the laying season.:73, 76 Under favorable conditions, eggs may be laid as early as mid January,:73 but egg laying is delayed at higher elevations. Heavy seasonal rainfall can extend breeding: young have been recorded in nests as late as August. Cactus wrens usually lay three or four eggs (although as many as seven have been recorded) which are smooth and ovate, colored white to pale pink and covered in brown speckles. Eggs are approximately 23\u00a0mm (0.91\u00a0in) \u00d7 17\u00a0mm (0.67\u00a0in) and average 3.57\u00a0g (0.126\u00a0oz) in weight. Egg laying begins about a week after nest completion, with one egg per day being laid in the morning. Incubation takes about 16 days and is done solely by females. Wrens are known to destroy the eggs and nests of other nearby birds, but do not engage in, nor suffer from, brood parasitism.\nYoung hatch asynchronously over the course of about three days, with their eyes closed, and are mostly bald, with sparse patches of fuzzy white down. They are fed (mostly insects) by both parents. Young make begging vocalizations at least as early as two days old, with the vocalizations evolving as the chicks age. Chicks are dependent on their parents for the first three weeks aft", "Dmitri Nikolaevich Smirnov (Russian: \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0432; 2 November 1948 \u2013 9 April 2020), also known by his pen names Dmitri N.

In London, people visited slum neighborhoods such as Whitechapel or Shoreditch in order to observe life in this situation. By 1884 wealthier people in New York City began to visit the Bowery and the Five Points, Manhattan on the Lower East Side, neighborhoods of poor immigrants, to see \"how the other half lives\".\nIn the 1980s in South Africa, black residents organized township tours to educate the whites in local governments on how the black population lived. Such tours attracted international tourists, who wanted to learn more about apartheid.\nIn the mid-1990s, international tours were organized with destinations in the most disadvantaged areas of developing nations, often known as slums. They have grown in popularity, and are often run and advertised by professional companies. In Cape Town, over 300,000 tourists visit the city each year to view the slums.\nGhetto tourism was first studied in 2005 by Michael Stephens in the cultural-criticism journal, PopMatters. Ghetto tourism includes all forms of entertainment \u2014 gangsta rap, video games, movies, TV, and other forms that allow consumers to traffic in the inner city without leaving home. International tourists to New York City in the 1980s led to a successful tourism boom in Harlem. By 2002, Philadelphia began offering tours of blighted inner-city neighborhoods.

The Wire Tour is a tour of slums in Baltimore.\nPrior to the release of Slumdog Millionaire in 2008, Mumbai was a slum tourist destination.\nIn December 2010, the first international conference on slum tourism was held in Bristol. A social network of people working in or with slum tourism has been set up.", "A mass (air) flow sensor (MAF) is a sensor used to determine the mass flow rate of air entering a fuel-injected internal combustion engine.\nThe air mass information is necessary for the engine control unit (ECU) to balance and deliver the correct fuel mass to the engine. Air changes its density with temperature and pressure. In automotive applications, air density varies with the ambient temperature, altitude and the use of forced induction, which means that mass flow sensors are more appropriate than volumetric flow sensors for determining the quantity of intake air in each cylinder.\nThere are two common types of mass airflow sensors in use on automotive engines. These are the vane meter and the hot wire. Neither design employs technology that measures air mass directly. However, with additional sensors and inputs, an engine's ECU can determine the mass flow rate of intake air.\nBoth approaches are used almost exclusively on electronic fuel injection (EFI) engines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0\u20135.0 volt or a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal that is proportional to the air mass flow rate, and both sensors have an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor incorporated into their housings for most post on-board diagnostics (OBDII) vehicles. Vehicles prior to 1996 could have MAF without an IAT. An example is 1994 Infiniti Q45.\nWhen a MAF sensor is used in conjunction with an oxygen sensor, the engine's air/fuel ratio can be controlled very accurately. The MAF sensor provides the open-loop controller predicted air flow information (the measured air flow) to the ECU, and the oxygen sensor provides closed-loop feedback in order to make minor corrections to the predicted air mass. Also see manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP sensor).", "Bursa Province (Turkish: Bursa ili) is a province in Turkey along the Sea of Marmara coast in northwestern Anatolia.

Animal-drawn vehicles have either a pair of shafts or a single pole projecting forwards for about the length of one animal. An animal between shafts wears harness breeching, which attaches forward to the shafts. As the animal slows, the vehicle runs forward, and the shafts pull the breeching forward against the haunches of the animal, which can thus slow the vehicle. A vehicle with a pole has a pair of animals either side of it \u2013 their breeching works in a similar way, attaching forward to the pole either directly or by way of their collars. In a larger team, the leaders are in front of the shafts or pole and thus cannot slow the vehicle; nevertheless, they sometimes wear breeching for show.\nBreeching may be omitted where the animal does not need to provide substantial braking. For example, in very light harness, such as in a sulky used for harness racing or in a light cart used with fine harness, the weight of the vehicle and passenger is little enough that the girth and crupper of the harness provide sufficient braking support. Breeching may also be omitted if the vehicle has efficient brakes on the wheels \u2013 examples include larger carriages and modern vehicles with disk brakes. Similarly, breeching and the requisite shafts or pole are not needed for a dragged load such as a plow or a log that will not move on its own, nor for a canal boat, which is towed by a long rope from the bank.\nHistorically, additional animals were sometimes used to brake very heavy vehicles on steep downhills, being hitched in harness breeching behind the load. This is still done when logging in very steep terrain.\nBreeching is not normally used for oxen in yokes, where braking is provided by pulling back on the yoke or girth (depending upon the type of yoke).", "This list of birds of Hawaii is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species seen naturally in the U.S. state of Hawaii as determined by Robert L. and Peter Pyle of the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, and modified by subsequent taxonomic changes. \nThe scope of this list encompasses the entire Hawaiian Islands chain, from Kure Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to the north, to the \"Big Island\" of Hawaii to the south.

Mitochondrial ATP synthase catalyzes ATP synthesis, utilizing an electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner membrane during oxidative phosphorylation. ATP synthase is composed of two linked multi-subunit complexes: the soluble catalytic core, F1, and the membrane-spanning component, F0, comprising the proton channel. The catalytic portion of mitochondrial ATP synthase consists of 5 different subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon) assembled with a stoichiometry of 3 alpha, 3 beta, and single representatives of the gamma, delta, and epsilon subunits. The proton channel likely has nine subunits (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, F6 and 8).

This layout is generally considered to be the best and has come to be the classical form. It contains the following elements:\nThe ba\u015f makam (\"head station\"), a top panel containing a bismallah or blessing\nThe g\u00f6bek (\"belly\"), a round shape containing the first part of the main text in naskh script. It often contains the description of Muhammad by Ali (according to Tirmidhi), with minor variations(see quote in the Origins section above).\nThe hil\u00e2l (\"crescent\"), an optional section with no text, which is often gilded.  A crescent encircling the g\u00f6bek, with its thick middle part at the bottom.  Together, the g\u00f6bek and hilal also evoke the image of the sun and the moon.\nThe k\u00f6sheler (\"corners\"), usually four rounded compartments surrounding the g\u00f6bek, typically containing the names of the four Rashidun or \"rightly-guided\" Caliphs according to Sunnis, or in some cases other titles of Muhammad, names of his companions, or some of the names of Allah.\nThe ayet or ku\u015fak (\"verse\" or \"belt\") section below the g\u00f6bek and crescent, containing a verse from the Quran, usually 21:107 (\"And We [God] did not send you  [Muhammad] except to be a mercy to the universe\"), or sometimes 68:4 (\"Truly, you [Muhammad] are of a tremendous nature\") or 48:28\u201329 (\"And God is significant witness that Muhammad is the messenger of God\").\nThe etek (\"skirt\" or lower part) containing the conclusion of the text begun in the g\u00f6bek, a short prayer, and the signature of the artist. If the main text fits completely in the g\u00f6bek, the etek may be absent.\nThe koltuklar (\"empty spaces\"), two alleys or side panels on either side of the etek that typically contain ornamentation \u2013 sometimes illuminated \u2013 but no text, although occasionally the names of some of the ten companions of Muhammad are found there.\nThe i\u00e7 and d\u0131\u015f pervaz (\"inner and outer frame\"), an ornamental border in correct proportion to the text.\nThe remainder of the space is taken up with decorative Ottoman illumination, of the type usual for the period, often with a border framing the whole in a contrasting design to the main central field that is the background of the text sections. The \"verse\" and \"corners\" normally use a larger thuluth script, while the \"head\" section with the bismallah is written in muhaqqaq. Unlike the literary genre of hilye, the text on calligraphic hilyes is generally in prose form.\nThe names in Turkish of the central structural elements of the hilye are, from top to bottom, ba\u015fmakam (head station), g\u00f6bek (belly), ku\u015fak (belt) and etek (skirt). This anthropomorphic naming makes it clear that the hilye represents a human body, whose purpose is \"to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct\". It has been suggested that Hafiz Osman's hilye design might have been inspired by the celebrated Hilye-i \u015eerif, which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said \"... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... \". If so, a hilye might have been meant to be not read but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text.\nThe standard Hilye-i \u015eerif composition has been followed by calligraphers since its creation in the late 17th century. Some examples from the 19th century and two made by Hafiz Osman can be seen below.\nHowever, deviations from the standard model do occur and many innovative designs have been produced as well.", "Both sides claimed victory. Although losses were fairly equal in terms of numbers\u20144,000\u00a0wounded or dead on each side\u2014the Coalition forces went into battle with 24,000\u00a0men while the French started with Gazan's division of about 6,000, which grew close to 8,000 when Dupont's men joined the fighting in the afternoon. Regardless, Gazan's division was nearly destroyed; the 30\u00a0percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division. Clearly for both sides, the fighting was hard. The weather had been cold; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways, and icicles \"like chandeliers\" hung from the trees.\nFor the Coalition, the Russians were secure on the north bank of the Danube, awaiting reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at D\u00fcrenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.\nFor the French, the survival of the Corps Mortier seemed nothing short of a miracle. The remainder of Gazan's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in Vienna, which the French acquired by deception later in the month. More importantly for them, the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions. Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft. They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems, overturning their boats. Tossed into the icy river, most had drowned. Despite this initial panic, Gazan's column retained its cohesion, and responded well to various difficult demands. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen: when he heard cannon fire, he directed his troops toward it to support the French division. In terms of French staffing, Mortier's failure to guard his flank, especially in the face of Napoleon's direct advice, adversely influenced his relationship with his commander. However, in the immediate weeks ahead, the flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had. In assessing the battle and its aftermath, historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan: \"Napoleon, aware of Mortier's danger and his own culpability for it, vented his frustration on Murat, whom he unjustly accused of abandoning Mortier for the empty glory of riding through Vienna.\" \nAfter the victory at Austerlitz, Napoleon dispersed the VIII\u00a0Corps and reassigned Mortier. However disappointed he may have been with Mortier, Napoleon was pleased with Gazan's performance. As recognition of his conduct in what the French called \"the immortal Battle of D\u00fcrenstein\", Gazan received the Officer's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.\nThe loss of Schmitt was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, he was the most experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and H\u00fcnigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Z\u00fcrich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother.

Its taxonomic affinities were unclear for a long time, giving rise to other common names, the pink-tailed bunting and the Przewalski's rosefinch.

Some were families of British or mixed-British ancestry who owed their status in Ireland to the Crown, such as the Earls of Cork (whose surname is Boyle and whose ancestral roots were in Herefordshire, England).\nAmong the prominent Anglo-Irish peers are:\nThe 1st Earl of Cork, Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, father of scientist Robert Boyle.\nThe 1st Baron Glenavy, second-last Lord Chancellor of Ireland and first Cathoirleach (or Chairman) of the Irish Senate (1922).\nThe 8th Marquess Conyngham, owner of the Slane Castle rock venue and candidate for Fine Gael in recent Irish general elections.\nThe 3rd Earl of Iveagh, of Gaelic Irish descent; head of the Guinness family who sat in the Irish Senate (1973\u20131977).\nValerie, Lady Goulding, founder of the Rehabilitation Institute and close associate of former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Charles Haughey.\nThe 6th Earl of Longford, Impresario at the Gate Theatre in Dublin in the 1950s.\nThe 7th Earl of Longford (who succeeded his brother (above) in the Earldom), British Labour Cabinet minister, biographer and friend of \u00c9amon de Valera.\nThe 3rd Earl of Rosse, astronomer and builder of the then-largest telescope in the world.\nThe 18th Baron of Dunsany, author.\nEdmond Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy, Irish peer.\nThe 1st Duke of Ormonde, 17th-century statesman, served as Lord Deputy of Ireland on two occasions and commanded Royalist forces in Ireland in the Irish Confederate Wars negotiating with the Irish Confederates on behalf of Charles I.\nMurrough, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, 6th Baron Inchiquin (1618\u20131674), of Gaelic Irish descent; a Parliamentary commander in the Irish Confederate Wars (1644\u20131648) before changing sides to become one of the leaders of the Royalist troops in Ireland during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649\u201353).\nField Marshal The 1st Duke of Wellington, Anglo-Irish general who fought many successful campaigns and defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. He later became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nUntil the year 1800, the peers of Ireland were all entitled to a seat in the Irish House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament of Ireland, in Dublin.  After 1800, under the provisions of the Act of Union, the Parliament of Ireland was abolished and the Irish peers were entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the British House of Lords, in London, as representative peers.  During the Georgian Era, titles in the peerage of Ireland were often granted by the British monarch to Englishmen with little or no connection to Ireland, as a way of preventing such honours from inflating the membership of the British House of Lords.\nA number of Anglo-Irish peers have been appointed by Presidents of Ireland to serve on their advisory Council of State. Some were also considered possible candidates for presidents of Ireland, including:\nValerie, Lady Goulding\nLord Killanin (though an Irish Catholic, rather than Anglo-Irish despite his peerage)\nLord Ashbourne (a renowned Gaelic scholar).", "Born in Krak\u00f3w, Anton de Kontski was one of five children, all musical. His sister Eugenia (b. 1816) was a singer; brother Stanislaw (b. 1820) a pianist who taught piano in Paris and composed salon pieces; brother Apolinary (1825\u20131879) a virtuoso violinist, composer and teacher who debuted at age five at the St. Petersburg court, studied with Paganini, toured Europe, and finally settled in Warsaw where in 1860 he founded the Music Institute; and brother Karol (1815\u20131867), violinist and composer, member of the orchestra of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris.\nAnton himself was a pianist and composer, a student of John Field in Moscow and a child prodigy. He also studied composition with Simon Sechter and piano with Sigismond Thalberg in Vienna. In 1845, in Paris, he performed in a concert at the Czartoryski salon together with Chopin. In 1849, he appeared in concerts in Spain and Portugal. Kontski reorganized the National Conservatory in Lisbon and for his efforts was awarded for the Order of Immaculate Conception. In the years 1851\u20131853, Kontski resided in Berlin, where he served as the court pianist to the King of Prussia. At that time, he gave concerts in Greece, Turkey, Egypt and Italy. In the years 1854\u20131867 he lived in St. Petersburg, where he organized an Amateur Music Society. He subsequently spent 16 years in London. Kontski settled in the United States in 1883 and resided first in Buffalo, NY, then in Grand Rapids, MI and San Francisco. He became a naturalized US citizen in 1892.\nHe was also something of a showman: he advertised himself as the only living pupil of Beethoven and used to play at least one piece in each concert with his hands under a folded blanket placed on the keyboard. In 1896, when de Kontski was visiting pianist with the Wellington Orchestral Society in New Zealand, the conductor Alfred Hill resigned in protest at this trick, which he considered charlatanry.\nTwo years before his death he embarked on a world tour, giving concerts in California, Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Thailand, the Philippines, Persia, and many provinces of the Russian Empire. He was the first classical pianist to give concerts in the Philippines. He was also the first musician to transcribe Azerbaijani folk music into Western notation. \nHis piece entitled Polish Patrol was published in Los Angeles in 1895 by The Barlett Music Co. with a portrait of the composer on the cover, and his Awaking of the Lion was very popular in 1870s California. A sign of his popularity is the fact that The Etude used his Dance des sorci\u00e8res as their first title when they began publishing sheet music in 1883. They also published his Persian March, Op. 369 in the December 1891 issue of the magazine.", "^ The season of the year of the first regular-season game of the primary NHL tenant.\n\u2020 Underwent extensive renovations from 2010 to 2013, resulting in a completely new arena bowl and concourses within the original structure.", "The discography of Europe, a Swedish hard rock band, consists of 11 studio albums, 35 singles, eight live albums, one extended play (EP), 24 music videos and 11 video albums. This list does not include solo material or side projects performed by the band members.\nThe band was formed under the name Force by vocalist Joey Tempest and guitarist John Norum in Upplands V\u00e4sby in 1979. After changing its name to Europe and winning a national talent contest in 1982, the band signed with the independent label Hot Records and released its debut album Europe in 1983 and Wings of Tomorrow in 1984. Europe subsequently signed with Epic Records in 1985 and released its third album, The Final Countdown in 1986. The band released two more albums, Out of This World in 1988 and Prisoners in Paradise in 1991, before going on hiatus in 1992.\nAfter a one-off performance in Stockholm on New Year's Eve 1999, Europe reunited in 2003 and released  Start from the Dark, which peaked at number 2 on the Swedish album chart in 2004.

This gives it several important differences from Chinatown, Downtown Crossing, and State along Washington Street to the north, which were all threaded among existing underground structures. Because it was easier to dig deeply on the empty plot, Tufts Medical Center station has a subsurface fare mezzanine, rather than having faregates located immediately adjacent to the platforms. The platform areas are much wider and taller than the older stations, and the inbound and outbound platforms are directly opposite each other, rather than offset.\nThe station was not constructed directly under Washington Street; it is angled towards Tremont Street to the west, as the line then curves towards Back Bay. Unlike the older stations, there is a single headhouse on the west side of Washington Street rather than smaller entrances on both sides of the street. This entrance is located under an overhang of a Tufts Medical Center building. There is a secondary entrance without elevator access, located on Tremont Street at Oak Street. Adding elevators to the South Cove entrance was considered by the MBTA in 2017.", "Inspired by Weinbrenner's early project, Schmitz constructed the monument over an artificial hill, and selected a pyramidal shape for a clear view of the surroundings. The base is 124 metres (407\u00a0ft) square. The main structure, at 91 metres (299\u00a0ft), is one of the tallest monuments in Europe. It is composed of two storeys. On the first story, a crypt is adorned by eight large statues of fallen warriors, each one next to smaller statues called the Totenw\u00e4chter (Guardians of the Dead). On the second story, the Ruhmeshalle (Hall of Fame) features four statues, each 9.5 metres (31\u00a0ft) tall, representing the four legendary historic qualities ascribed to the German people: bravery, faith, sacrifice, and fertility. The statues of the monument were sculpted by Christian Behrens and his apprentice Franz Metzner, who finished the remaining statues after Behrens's death in 1905. Metzner worked on the sculptures at the top and inside the memorial.\nThe memorial is constructed in granite and sandstone. The cupola is decorated with primitive Germanic shapes, inspired by Egyptian and Assyrian sculpture. Schmitz also planned to create an accompanying complex for ceremonies that would include a court, a stadium and parade grounds. However, only a reflecting pool and two processional avenues were ultimately completed. Surrounding the monument are oaks, a symbol of masculine strength and endurance to the Germanic people of antiquity. The oaks are complemented by evergreens, symbolising feminine fecundity, and they are located in a subordinate position to the oaks. The 12 metres (39\u00a0ft) main figure on the front of the memorial represents the archangel Michael, considered the \"War god of Germans\".\nThe design of the monument was intended to commemorate the spirit of the German folk. Unlike previous monuments that commemorated the achievements of the monarchy, this one was created to commemorate the end of the battle in 1813, the establishment of a German community, and the maturation of the Germans as an organised ethnic group.", "Salmagundi; or The Whim-whams and Opinions of Launcelot Langstaff, Esq. & Others, commonly referred to as Salmagundi, was a 19th-century satirical periodical created and written by American writer Washington Irving, his oldest brother, William, and James Kirke Paulding.  The collaborators produced twenty issues at irregular intervals between January 24, 1807 and January 15, 1808.\nSalmagundi lampooned New York City culture and politics in a manner much like today's Mad magazine. It was in the November 11, 1807, issue that Irving first attached the name \"Gotham\" to New York City, based on the alleged stupidity of the people of Gotham, Nottinghamshire.\nIrving and his collaborators published the periodical using a wide variety of pseudonyms, including Will Wizard, Launcelot Langstaff, Pindar Cockloft, and Mustapha Rub-a-Dub Keli Khan.\nIrving and Paulding discontinued Salmagundi in January 1808, following a disagreement with publisher David Longworth over profits.", "Passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 designated $8 billion for the development of a high-speed intercity passenger rail system. The Federal Railroad Administration named Florida one of ten high speed rail corridors potentially eligible for the federal funding.  The HSRA met on February 26, 2009, to begin planning their application for these funds.  Due to the passage of time, potential legal issues, and new federal funding criteria rendering the earlier bids from 2003 inapplicable, the decision was made in May 2009 that a new bidding process would be necessary.  A first round application was submitted in August 2009 for $30 million to conduct a two-year environmental study on the Orlando-Miami route.  In October 2009, the authority submitted an application during the second round for the entire Tampa - Orlando - Miami corridor, broken into two components: Orlando-Tampa and Orlando-Miami.  Connect Us, a political action committee, was launched on August 18, 2009, to rally public support for these applications.\nOn December 16, the Florida Legislature passed a bill authorizing FDOT move forward with the purchase from CSX of the Central Florida Rail Corridor for the SunRail commuter rail project, and providing much needed additional funding for South Florida's Tri-Rail commuter rail system.  Funding of these initiatives was vital to the state's hopes to win federal HSR funding, as it showed the state of Florida was committed to creating a comprehensive rail network allowing connectivity between high speed rail and local mass transit systems. The legislation also replaced the Florida High Speed Rail Authority with the Florida Rail Enterprise, a new agency created under the FDOT, responsible for construction, maintenance, and promotion of the state's high-speed rail system, as well as development and operation of publicly funded passenger rail systems in general.\nOn January 28, 2010, the White House announced that Florida would receive $1.25 billion of its request, about half of the cost of the Tampa-Orlando segment. The state's efforts towards high speed rail between 2000 and 2005 put Florida ahead of the field in terms of the level of planning already completed, and this proved to be a major factor in winning the funds.  The preservation of the I-4 corridor by the FDOT, and completion of the environmental impact studies in 2005 meant that the project could have proceeded to construction in a very short time frame for a relatively affordable cost. In March 2010 the Florida Rail Enterprise was still seeking to refine cost estimates based on advanced engineering, finish development of possible Early Works (Install permanent barrier systems along most of I-4 and remove/relocate elements in median) and contract for bid in 2010 and finally initiate a new bid procurement process specific to the Tampa to Orlando phase. In June 2010, the Federal Railroad Administration issued its record of final decision, the final stage of approval for the design, purchase of land and construction of phase one. Tendering was thus able to begin.  In October 2010, Florida received $800 million more towards construction from the FY 2010 High Speed Rail allocations.\nIn December 2010 the US Department of Transportation redistributed approximately $1.2 billion in HSR funds that had been rejected by governors elect in Wisconsin and Ohio. Florida was projected to receive as much as $342.3 million of the reallocated rail funds which would have closed the gap of the entire projected cost of project. Construction of the line was to begin in 2011, with the initial phase completed by 2014.", "The electoral district covered the Yekaterinoslav Governorate.

The XX Corps' infantry divisions, the 10th (Irish), the 60th (2/2nd London), and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions with support from infantry in the 53rd (Welsh) Division fought the Seventh Ottoman Army's III Corps' 24th, 26th and 53rd Divisions.\nAfter the evacuation of Jerusalem by the Ottoman Seventh Army, the British XX Corps held a line which ran across the Jerusalem to Jericho and Jerusalem to Nablus roads 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) north and east of Jerusalem. This line continued to the west through the hills to Beit Ur el Foka and Suffa. Jerusalem was still within range of Ottoman artillery and with the opposing sides in such close proximity there was still the risk of counterattack. An offensive to push the Ottoman Army further northwards was planned for 24 December 1917, but was delayed due to bad weather.\nIn a letter to the War Office, Allenby had written on 4 December of his desire to capture Bireh. The plan now was for infantry from the 60th (2/2nd London) Division to advance north astride the Jerusalem to Nablus road with infantry from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division advancing eastwards from Beit Ur el Foka to converge on the Bireh-Ramalla ridge.\nThe British were prepared for battle when an Ottoman Army counterattack was launched at 01:30 on 27 December, which fell on the infantry from the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade, 60th (2/2nd London) Division, on the Nablus road. The Ottoman force's initial objectives were a line of villages, including Nebi Samweil 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) in front of their starting positions. They were focused towards Tell el Ful, a hill east of the Nablus road about 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) north of Jerusalem defended by the 60th (2/2nd London) Division. This Ottoman attack on Tell el Ful initially drove the British outposts back and captured several important places. The engagement continued for two days and was ultimately unsuccessful.\nAlso during the morning of 27 December the British infantry from the 10th (Irish) and the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions advanced about 4000\u00a0yds (4000\u00a0m) on a front of 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km).

The 74th (Yeomanry) Division captured Beitunia and the 10th (Irish) Division pushed to the east of Ain Arik. With Ottoman and German machine guns hard to locate amongst the boulders, the fighting was severe and stubborn. On 29 November the 60th (2/2nd London) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were joined by the 53rd (Welsh) Division.

Despite an ageing playing list and predictions that the team would struggle in 2011, Geelong finished the regular season in second position on the ladder, with only three losses for the season. The team then won its first two matches of the finals series to qualify for the 2011 AFL Grand Final against reigning premier Collingwood, where Geelong proceeded to win the match by 38 points to claim its third premiership in the space of five seasons, and the club's ninth VFL/AFL premiership overall. Jimmy Bartel, who played in each of these three premiership wins, was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for his best on ground performance.

It was the first time Fremantle had won a final outside its home state in its 18-year existence. This unexpected loss resulted in some commentators stating that it was the end of Geelong's era of recent success. In the reserves however, Geelong won its third VFL premiership, defeating Port Melbourne by 33 points in the 2012 VFL Grand Final.\nGeelong again participated in the finals series across the next two seasons, reaching the preliminary finals in 2013 and the semi-finals in 2014.

The old royal grounds at Meudon were allocated for this work, with the Ch\u00e2teau de Meudon chosen as the centre, with Nicolas-Jacques Cont\u00e9 as director. Two French Balloon Corps balloon companies had already been created, and the new organisation's role was to build balloons and train their pilots and operators.\nThe first balloon, the Entreprenant, was built within four months, and on 31 October 1794, the National School of Ballooning was created, with Cont\u00e9 as its director. Many other balloons were then built in a short period, including, in 1795, l\u2019Intr\u00e9pide which, with the First Balloon Company, was captured by Austrian troops in 1796, and is now on display at the Austrian Military Museum in Vienna - the oldest aircraft in Europe. They were all spherical hydrogen balloons with a diameter of at least 10 metres (33\u00a0ft). Cont\u00e9 himself had improved production methods for hydrogen and the treatment of the gas bags.\nIn 1798 Napoleon sent one of the balloon companies in one ship to Egypt. It was sunk by the British at Aboukir and all the equipment was lost. The two balloon companies were disbanded soon afterwards, and work on balloons at Meudon ceased.\nIn 1877, balloons had regained their importance after their successful use in the Siege of Paris (1870\u201371). L\u00e9on Gambetta, the Minister for War, who had himself escaped from Paris by balloon, created a commission of air communications, and Colonel Charles Renard was put in charge of military ballooning. In 1877, he became director of the  l'Etablissement Central de l'A\u00e9rostation Militaire (Central Establishment of Military Ballooning), and he created corps of balloonists, with a research centre at Meudon.\nThis was a new development in the grounds of the ch\u00e2teau and on the edge of the forest of Meudon. It included a hexagonal lake, the \u00c9tang de Chalais, hence the location was named Chalais-Meudon. A large series of buildings was planned. It included the Research Laboratory for Military Ballooning which became the Military Aeronautical Laboratory.\nThe Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1878 had a huge Great Gallery of Machines, designed by Henri de Dion. Renard brought the structure to Chalais-Meudon for use as a balloon store and workshop. It was named Hangar Y (all buildings at the site were allocated a letter) and the building nearest to it, which was used for the production of hydrogen, was named Building Z. Hangar Y has dimensions of: length 70\u00a0m (230\u00a0ft), width 41\u00a0m (135\u00a0ft), height 26\u00a0m (85\u00a0ft).\nBalloons continued to be developed and built here, with great expansion of balloon manufacturing during World War I. Balloon parks were created, with steam winches used to move the balloons, and most of the components were built on site, including wicker baskets and hydrogen generators. Especially important at that time were the Caquot balloons, produced for all the allied countries. The designer, Albert Caquot went on to plan the Chalais-Meudon wind tunnel and to propose the aviation museum (see below).

Genos 5, 1934)\nCharlotte Disbrowe visited Sweden in 1834, where her father, (Sir Edward Cromwell Disbrowe, a senior a diplomat with the British Foreign Office) was stationed. She met Suchtelen and mentioned in her biography that:", "In the earliest days of athletic competitions, results were recorded and posted on bulletin boards whereby spectators and athletes crowded around them to view the official results. The earliest account of announcing came at the athletic games of the Staten Island Athletic Club in 1884. The account is announcing began as a bit of joke. A number of events were tight and spectators crowded around the boards to get the results. Folk who could not see the board clamored after the results of various athletes. Fred Burns, know for his sharp piercing voice, stepped up and began reading off the answers to the crowd. Fred received a huge ovation for his efforts and announcing was born.\nA separate account had Fred, sidelined from an athletic event with rheumatism in the winter of 1886, shouting loudly during the games. His close friend Malcolm W. Ford, the Jim Thorpe of his time, recommended to him to try announcing events. However, Fred had already been announcing by this time. Regardless, Fred and Malcolm were very close friends until that latter's 1902 murder-suicide of his novelist brother, Paul Ford. Malcolm loved Fred's little girls, Florence and Gladyss, and was seen on more than one occasion holding their hands at athletic clubs and venues where both Burns and Ford trained, officiated and competed.\nFrom these early beginnings, \"F.W. Burns\" could be read in all the New York papers multiple times per week in relation to athletic contests and boxing matches, sporting a moniker brand new to the sporting world, Announcer. The more notable athletic clubs in the northeast, such as the New York Athletic Club, created roles for an official announcer. Although Fred Burns remained the preference of most all athletic organizations in the northeast, he could not cover all events and other names began to appear. Fred Burns was the first announcer of record in Madison Square Garden I in 1889 and in Madison Square Garden II in 1890. Current events are held in Madison Square Garden IV.\nBy the 1890s, all notable boxing matches employed Fred Burns as the ring announcer. He announced some of the biggest names in boxing including Godfrey, Choynski and so many more.  When George Dixon defeated England's Fred Johnson in 1892 to become the first ever African-American boxing champion at any weight, Fred Burns was the announcer. When Jim Jeffries beat Bob Fitzsimmons in 1899 for his first Heavyweight Championship, both pugilists got announced by Fred Burns. Fred became known nationally, recognized as the announcer of all major boxing bouts between Philadelphia and Boston.\nDuring the \"Gentleman\" Jim Corbett and Bob Fitzsimmons Heavyweight Championship in 1897 in Carson City, Nevada, a special telegraph was setup in the Lenox Lyceum Theatre in Manhattan which received all the details of the bout. Fred Burns read out all the action, blow-by-blow, to a crowd  of people becoming the first play-by-play sportscaster on record. The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight was, also, filmed by Enoch Rector lasting more than 100 minutes making it the first feature film in history.\nHis announcing in cycling was tantamount to his involvement in the sport. It was in cycling that Fred Burns introduced the world to the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 megaphone in 1894. He became known in the sporting world as the first professional megaphoner, a term commonly used for announcer until public address systems took over athletics in the 1930s. He announced some of the biggest cyclists of the time including: Jimmy Michael, Arthur Linton, Earl Kiser and Eddie Bald.\nWhen automobiles became the new rage, Burns was called upon to announce the time tests. At the world's first automobile show held in Madison Square Garden in November 1900, the organizers engaged Fred Burns as the announcer. When Henri Fournier, the best chauffeur (original term for race car driver) of his day, drove a world-record mile in 51.8 seconds against a head-wind during the race meetings of the Long Island Automobile Club, the man with the megaphone was Fred Burns.\nIn 1894, the management of the New York Giants baseball club leverage", "Pakistan and Argentina formally established relations in October, 1951.

It contains two relatively small species both named jackdaws. They have a blackish crown, wings and tail, the rest of the plumage being paler. The word Coloeus is New Latin, from the Ancient Greek for jackdaws: koloi\u00f3s (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2).\nWhile some authors consider Coloeus a subgenus of Corvus, others have classified Coloeus as a distinct genus in the family Corvidae. Following Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide, the International Ornithological Congress has also reassigned the two jackdaw species from the genus Corvus to the genus Coloeus.\nThe species are the western jackdaw (Corvus monedula), which breeds in the British Isles and western Europe, Scandinavia, northern Asia and Northern Africa, and its eastern counterpart, the Daurian jackdaw (Corvus dauuricus), found from China and eastern Siberia to Japan. The eastern species is smaller than the western jackdaw, and in the adult the pale areas of the plumage are almost white, whereas in the western bird these areas are pale grey. The iris is pale in western jackdaw and dark in Daurian jackdaw. The two species are otherwise very similar in shape, calls, and behaviour. There is an argument for lumping the subgenus members as one species, but they do not interbreed where their ranges meet in Mongolia.", "San Gil Abad is a church in Zaragoza, Spain.", "Dogs of different breeds were later reintroduced by European settlers and visitors to the Marquesas.\nThe first European dogs seen were those that accompanied Spanish explorers \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s in 1595. While they were on Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal one of the small dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish.\nPossibly the first dogs reintroduced were those left by American ships during the early 1800s in the care of early beachcombers, missionaries and settlers who kept them as pets. One of the first reported cases was a New Haven dog named Pato, who had been \"found guilty of sheep stealing about the year 1797 and was banished for the above crime\". Around 1798, Captain Edmund Fanning left him on Nuku Hiva in the care of British missionary William Pascoe Crook who left him with a local ruler Keattonnue (i.e. King Cato), but on June 8, 1803, another American Captain Brinell recalled Pato and replaced him with two other dogs.\nDuring the Nuku Hiva Campaign of 1813, United States Naval Captain David Porter reported a few dogs on the island and observed the islanders were afraid of the two mastiffs on board his ship.\nBy the 1890s, English traveler Frederick William Christian noted the ideological conflict over dog meat consumption as island populations increased. He noted how the Marquesans living in the eastern valleys of the island of Hiva Oa had resumed eating baked dog meat \"with delight\" while the inhabitants of the western valleys \"will barely touch [dog meat] even in times of famine\". Christian also observed dog being eaten on Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. French artist Paul Gauguin depicted scenes including dogs in the Marquesas in several works while he lived on Hiva Oa. His 1902 painting Le sorcier d'Hiva-Oa ou Le Marquisien \u00e0 la cape rouge possibly depicts a dog killing the now-extinct Marquesas swamphen (Porphyrio paepae).\nIn Herman Melville's 1846 semi-fictionalized work, Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life, the narrator Tommo gives an unflattering account of dogs living in the valley of Tai P\u012b on Nuku Hiva:\nI Think I must enlighten the reader a little about the natural history of the valley. \nWhence, in the name of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!\u2014Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, speckled hides\u2014fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale\u2014that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come. \n\nScurvy curs! they were my abhorrence; I should have liked nothing better than to have been the death of every one of them.

All of the churches were confiscated and made into national property, and were put on sale beginning in 1791. Most of the churches were demolished not by the Revolutionaries, but by real estate speculators, who bought them, took out and sold the furnishings, and demolished the buildings for building materials and to create land for real estate speculation. Twenty-two churches and fifty-one convents were destroyed between 1790 and 1799, and another 12 churches and 22 convents between 1800 and 1814. Convents were particular targets, because they had large buildings and extensive gardens and lands which could be subdivided and sold.

It has a role in ethics by an analysis of the structure of will, valuing, happiness, and care for others (in empathy and sympathy). Phenomenologist Heidegger discussed care, conscience, and guilt, moving to \"authenticity\", which in turn led to the feminism of Simone de Beauvoir and existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre, both based on phenomenology's considerations of authenticity and its role in bad faith. Sartre analyzed the logical problem of \"bad faith\" as it relates to authenticity, and where he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in good faith.\nJean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into existentialism, using the concepts of bad faith and \"authenticity\" in the ethics of belief. In Being and Nothingness, Sartre begins his discussion of bad faith by raising the question of how bad faith self-delusion is possible. Sartre calls \"bad faith\" a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce excuses, bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself. When it becomes necessary to elude this stance it has made of itself, it then adopts the first-person perspective. In neither case can the deception fully succeed. Without these two facets of existence, if consciousness was unitary and not divisible, as in the indivisible \"I\" in \"I think, therefore I am\", it would be impossible to explain how the very project of self-deception could be possible. The Freudian theory of the unconscious is viewed by Sartre as based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the \"fundamental project\" of an individual's life is considered to be valid.\nExistentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the belief that there is something intrinsically good in itself, which is inherent in the world as absolute value and is discoverable by people, the \"spirit of seriousness\", which he argued leads to bad faith. He argued that people fall into the spirit of seriousness because they take their values too seriously, and forget that values are contingent, chosen and assigned subjectively. In Sartre's words, \"the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as transcendent givens,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of 'desirable' from the ontological structure of things to their simple material constitution.\"", "August Julius Geppert (November 7, 1856 \u2013 March 12, 1937) was a German pharmacologist born in Berlin.\nHe studied medicine at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, earning his doctorate in 1880 with a thesis titled Die Gase des arteriellen Blutes im Fieber (The arterial blood gases during fever). From 1880 to 1885 he worked as an assistant at the second medical clinic in Berlin, becoming a lecturer at the University of Bonn during the following year. From 1893 he was an associate professor of pharmacology, attaining the title of \"full professor\" in 1899 at the University of Giessen.\nGeppert is remembered for research involving the physiology of respiration, anesthetics and hygiene. With physiologist Nathan Zuntz (1847-1920), he  developed the Zuntz-Geppert'schen Respirationsapparat (Zuntz-Geppert respiratory apparatus).", "The following past and present members of the Chamber of Deputies that are/were affiliated with the Evangelical caucus", "Texada Island is the largest island in the Strait of Georgia of British Columbia, Canada.

Construction on the facility\u2014originally named Riverside High School\u2014began in 1959.\nThe program for the school's 25th jubilee in 1985 suggests that the school was named Riverside High School \u201cpartly because it was on the [Colorado] river, but also because there was a well-known high school in Fort Worth at the time named Riverside High School.\u201d The school's 1985 yearbook similarly shares, \u201cWhile under construction, Johnston was called Riverside High School because it was near the Colorado River. Things soon changed. \u2018River rats\u2019 wasn\u2019t an appropriate nickname [for a mascot].\u201d  The 1985 jubilee program confirms that even before the school was opened, \u201cthe nickname \u2018Riverside Rats\u2019 was already being applied. So several students at Allan Junior High, who would be coming to the new high school, petitioned the school board to change the name. Besides, hidden in the school board regulations was a ruling that stated that all schools in Austin must be named for a person and that person must be dead.\u201d\nStudents of Allan Junior High submitted a list of possible names for a renamed school. The list of possible names that came before the Austin School Board included such heroes as David Crockett, John H. Reagan, Sidney Lanier, and Albert Sidney Johnston, an American Civil War hero buried in Austin.\n\nBoard minutes reflect that the school board ceded to the request of future students to change the name of the school to honor \u201csome historical or educational figure such as the other high schools of the city.\u201d  Three names were ultimately considered by the Board: Davy Crockett High School, Coronado High School, and Albert Sidney Johnston High School. \nWith heightened activities focused on the centennial celebration of the American Civil War (1860-1865), the school was renamed after Albert Sidney Johnston, an American Civil War general buried at the Texas State Cemetery, 3.5 miles west of the school. The next two high schools built by the Austin Public Schools during the centennial celebration would also be named for Confederate heroes: Sidney Lanier High School (which opened in 1961) and John H. Reagan High School (which opened in 1965), prompting some to speculate that the naming of these three schools for Confederate heroes was a \"push to glorify the Confederacy as a deliberate slap in the face to minorities and the federal government after the 1954 Supreme Court school desegregation decision Brown v. Board of Education.\"\nIt seems that Albert Sidney Johnston, a native-Kentuckian, was relatively unknown at that time. In an Austin Statesman article entitled, \u201cYes, Ma\u2019m, He\u2019s Texan,\u201d Anita Brewer wrote, \u201cSome Austinites are perplexed about this man, Johnston. Just who was this fellow? Why was he important enough for the Austin Board of Education and the future students of Austin\u2019s new eastside high school to scuttle a perfectly good name like 'Riverside' to name the school for Johnston? The School Board voted unanimously Monday night to rename the new school the Albert Sidney Johnston High School\u2026. Historians are cheering the board\u2019s decision as a fine one and a belated and overdue tribute to one of the greatest of the early Texans.\u201d  A photo of Johnston's tomb at the Texas State Cemetery was featured in the newspaper, with the caption, \u201cJohnston interest is revived as School Board names new high school for famed Confederate.\u201d\n\nWith Founding Principal Gordon Bailey's death thirty years later, on January 27, 1990, alumni rallied to rename Johnston High School for their longtime principal of happy memory. In May 1990, a petition was brought by alumni to the Board of Trustees of the Austin Independent School District, to rename the school for Bailey. The school's newspaper reported: \u201c\u2018Papa Bailey,\u2019 as he was affectionately called, often met his students at the door each day.

From 2001 to 2005, Ludlam worked for Greens state parliamentarian Robin Chapple. From 2005 to 2007, he worked as a communications officer for Australian Greens Senator Rachel Siewert. At the 2005 state election, Ludlam unsuccessfully contested the seat of Murchison-Eyre, obtaining 4.98 percent of the primary vote.\nAt the 2007 federal election, Ludlam was elected to the Australian Senate, representing Western Australia. His term commenced on 1 July 2008, and he took his place on 26 August with other incoming Senators.\nFollowing the 2013 federal election, it was initially announced that Ludlam had lost his bid for re-election, eliminated by Palmer United Party candidate Zhenya Wang, with his term due to expire on 30 June 2014. However an Australian Electoral Commission recount of votes raised some controversy over the loss of ballot papers, and resulted in Ludlam and Wayne Dropulich of the Australian Sports Party winning the fifth and sixth Senate spots respectively. After the recount, it came to light that there were 1375 missing votes and the High Court of Australia ruled that the recount results were invalid because the number of votes lost far exceeded the margin between candidates. At the 5 April 2014 re-election, Ludlam safely held his seat in the Senate.\nLudlam has been involved in numerous political campaigns, including opposition to uranium mining at Jabiluka and in Western Australia, nuclear weapons, foreign military bases, and support for Aboriginal land rights, peace and disarmament, recognition of climate change, advocacy of fair trade and equitable globalisation, and energy market reform.\nAfter taking his seat in the Senate, Ludlam campaigned against internet censorship, for strengthened protections for public ownership of the National Broadband Network, and for the fair treatment of Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks publishing organisation.\nIn 2011, he successfully advocated to restore $264\u00a0million to the National Rental Affordability Scheme which funded the construction of thousands of affordable rental homes.\nA former film maker, artist and graphic designer by trade, Ludlam has employed some communications tools to help with campaigns. He created the Bike Blackspot App, a smart phone application that enabled cyclists to lobby for better bike funding. In 2007, he created a 30-minute documentary on why he believes nuclear energy is not the solution to climate change, titled \"Climate of Hope\".\nAt the 2014 Western Australian Senate election the Greens won in excess of a quota with the primary vote increasing from 9.5 to 15.6 percent, re-electing Ludlam.\nOn 6 May 2015, Ludlam was elected unopposed to serve as Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens, serving alongside Senator Larissa Waters.

Ludlam stated that he had previously assumed he lost his New Zealand citizenship when he naturalised as an Australian citizen in his mid-teens. Ludlam's resignation led to a number of MPs and Senators publicly clarifying their citizenship status, and also led to fellow Greens senator and deputy leader Larissa Waters's resignation four days later, after discovering she held Canadian citizenship.\nOn 7 October 2019, Ludlam was arrested at an Extinction Rebellion protest.", "Archbishop Jan Cieplak (17 August 1857 - 17 February 1926) was a Polish Roman Catholic priest and bishop.", "Joseph Lucas (12 April 1834 \u2013 27 December 1902) was a lamp manufacturer and the founder of electrical equipment manufacturer Lucas Industries.", "As of 8 August 2020, there were 22802 confirmed cases in Costa Rica along with 228 deaths and 7589 recoveries.

The various churches and chapels in Hof at this time were all under the head pastor (Oberpfarrer) of Hof, Margrave Friedrich von Brandenburg of the Hohenzollern family. This family often fought amongst themselves during the reformation using religion to gain political power. Friedrich tended to side with the Catholic Church against his brother George \"the Pious\" who used the new Protestant religion to his advantage.\nIn 1524, a reforming priest named Kaspar L\u00f6hner was reassigned from his preaching position at Kloster Birkenfeld, after complaints from the Abbess, and brought to Hof under Head Pastor Friedrich v. Brandenburg. L\u00f6hner had been performing Mass in German and singing German songs during the Mass. He arrived in Hof where his preaching continued to carry a certain reformation flavor. This is understandable given that he was a friend of Martin Luther who had accompanied him from Wittenberg and Augsburg in 1518.\nSoon after L\u00f6hner arrived in Hof the radical lay-preacher from Zwickau, Nikolaus Storch, also arrived in Hof. According to the Hof chronicler Enoch Widmann, Storch was in Hof at the end of 1524 working as a weaver, but still preaching and gaining followers. Previously a co-worker with Thomas M\u00fcntzer, Storch is also considered a forerunner of the Anabaptist movement, because Widmann recorded him as having preached and practiced adult baptism in Hof. This was opposed by L\u00f6hner and others in Hof and towards the end of January in 1525 he applied to the mayor of Zwickau to be allowed to return there. This was refused and according to Philip Melancthon (letter to Joachim Camerarius, 17 April 1525) Storch played a leading role in the Peasants War of 1525.\nL\u00f6hner's first stay in Hof was also short-lived and Head Pastor Friedrich von Brandenburg had him removed the year after he arrived (1525) and he was replaced by the Catholic priest Wolfgang Thech. On Easter of 1527 Thech had his beard and hair purposely set on fire by young men while he was impersonating Christ in a Harrowing of Hell re-enactment. Believing they had been taught to disrespect the priesthood by men like L\u00f6hner, Thech left Hof for Halle an der Saale.\nAfter time in Wittenberg (1526) and then Oelzntiz (1527) L\u00f6hner was then reinstated in 1528 in Hof by Friedrich's Lutheran brother the Margrave George the Pious. L\u00f6hner then returned to Hof in league with the Hof born theologian, mathematician, and school master Nikolaus Medler (who was also a student of Luther's). Together they more boldly introduced the Reformation. The first Evangelical (Lutheran) communion service in Hof was held by L\u00f6hner at St. Michaeliskirche on September 5, 1529. This public act marks a major turning point in which Hof began to assert itself as openly Lutheran against the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church. However, L\u00f6hner and Medler continued to face stiff opposition to these changes as their subsequent removal from Hof reveals.\nPastor Kaspar L\u00f6hner was a leading theologian and writer in his day and he wrote a church liturgy (Gottesdienstordnung), catechism, and a hymnal among other writings. While in Hof he married Margarethe Felitscher, daughter of the Mayor (B\u00fcrgermeister) of Hof Konrad Felitscher, and by which he became the father of John Joshua L\u00f6ner and the great-grandfather of the famous Lutheran theologian and hymn writer Joshua Stegmann.\nL\u00f6hner and Medler both continued to receive opposition from powerful individuals including the regional governor (Landhauptmann) Christoph von Beulwitz who was a supporter of the Bishop of Bamberg. Being acquainted with Martin Luther, both Pastor L\u00f6hner and Schoolmaster Medler asked him for advice concerning this opposition and received a letter from Luther addressed from Wittenberg on June 7, 1531 which encouraged them to stay. The letter begins:\n\u2192\"Martin Luther an die verehrten Br\u00fcder in Christo und treuen B\u00fcr", "Although the site has a long history of use\u2014occupied in the Final Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Early Iron Age\u2014the most visible remains are the houses and communal buildings of Archaic date (600-500 BC). The public buildings of Archaic date cluster close to the peak on the west and south sides of the South Acropolis and cover a total area of over 0.60 hectares. Each produced evidence of destruction and abandonment in the early 5th century BC. This destruction marks the end of the city's life and a long period of occupation. The Archaic rebuilding expanded the settlement to its maximum size (c. 15 hectares), created a zone of communal buildings on the upper west slope of the South Acropolis, and formalized what can be called civic architecture\u2014generally supra-household communal spaces accommodating a variety of possible activities and configurations of groups.\n\nAmong the Archaic remains is a multi-room structure called the Communal Dining Building, which the excavators have interpreted as a possible andreion\u2014a dining hall used for corporate syssitia, the communal mess of the city's male citizenry organized in hetairiai; and the Monumental Civic Building, a large hall, about 200 square metres in internal area, with a stepped bench built against the walls on the interior, and an adjoining two-room shrine.\n \nBoth the Communal Dining Building and Monumental Civic Building were supplied by adjacent service complexes, comprising multiple store rooms (with food provisions stored in decorated pithoi) and kitchens equipped with large stone-lined hearths. The Service Building of the Monumental Civic Building also contained a well-preserved olive press facility\u2014the earliest documented lever-and-weights press, or beam press, in the post-Bronze Age Aegean. Although an Archaic beam press has been reported from excavations at the Greek city of Klazomenai, the evidence for olive pressing at Azoria includes a press bench, press beds, sockets for wooden beams, a press weight, roller-crusher and mortar block, a collection basin, a small trapetum mortarium, a hearth and cooking stand, oil-separation vessels, and quantities of press cake (crushed olive pits, collected after grinding and pressing for use as fuel for hearths). \nPots inscribed in Greek (both inscriptions and graffiti) are found within the building. An interesting find from the olive-press room is a reused pithos rim with its handles inscribed with the Eteocretan inscription \u039e\u03a1\u03a4\u0391\u039a.\n\nThe Communal Dining Building had at least three store rooms (with remains of grapes, olives and grains), three kitchens, and three dining rooms (extant). The floor of the building is littered with food debris, drinking and dining wares, and large decorated krater stands, and bronze armor. A separate room had a ground altar with burned food debris, evidently used for regular chthonic sacrifices. It has been argued that in Cretan cities, the activities of the domestic or private symposium, typical of Archaic Athenian contexts, were transferred to supra-household communal but segregated feasting venues such as the andreion.\nThe shrine of the Monumental Civic Building is equipped with a curbed hearth and altar on which were found a variety of terracotta votive female figurines (stylistically dated to 8th and 7th centuries BC), votive stands and vessels, and food offerings. The finds from the main hall of the Monumental Civic Building\u2014roasted leg joints of sheep and goat; chick peas and legumes (found preserved in pots on the floor); drinking and dining wares; stone kernoi (offering tables) carved into the top step of the bench, and a Minoan-style kernos lying face down on top of the bench\u2014indicate that it was used for public banquets and formal cult activities; it may have had ceremonial functions similar to those associated with magistrates' buildings (prytaneion) commonly identified in Greek city-states such as the neighboring poleis of Lato and Dreros.", "In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers  to a geography with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture).

Speaking at the naming event, Bob Murray explained the inspiration for the name came from the Coal mining heritage of the region and the stadium's Monkwearmouth Colliery site:\n\"For many years, miners at Wearmouth Colliery carried with them a Davy lamp as part of their working lives. Reflecting this tradition, the name allows the image of this light to shine forever.\"\nTo emphasise the fact, a statue of a miner's Davy lamp was located in front of the stadium's ticket office, adjacent to the stadium.\nThe name initially drew mixed reactions from Sunderland fans many unhappy that the name was already associated with the home ground of S.L. Benfica.  A film crew for the Premier Passions documentary series, recorded the moment that Bob Murray faced Sunderland fans immediately after the naming with many expressing their disappointment. The similarity to the name of Benfica's home, Est\u00e1dio da Luz, often anglicised to The Stadium of Light, has led to some visiting fans and reporters to erroneously assume that Sunderland's home was named after the Portuguese stadium. Murray responded directly to this in a 2017 interview with the Evening Chronicle, in which he said\nThe Estadio de Luz in Portugal isn\u2019t the Stadium of Light, it is named after the area \u2013 Luz. It\u2019s like, say, Elland Road or Old Trafford. We are the only club whose stadium has that name, and it was because of the history of the region that I named it. \nIn the same interview, Murray revealed that shortly after the stadium opened he was approached by a representative of the Labour government asking if he would consider renaming the stadium after Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in September 1997. Murray refused the request as he believed the stadium should be named in honour of those in the region who had worked in darkness.\nThe 'Of Light' suffix became a recognisable part of the Sunderland A.F.C. brand, and was used in a number of other areas related to the club; the Academy of Light is the club's training facility and youth academy, the Foundation of Light is a registered charity affiliated with the club and the Beacon of Light is a sports and education centre, owned by the Foundation, which is adjacent to the stadium.

The plans were shelved shortly after. The possibility of selling the naming rights was floated again by chief executive Margaret Byrne in 2013. Discussing the options of selling the stadium name in October 2018, chairman Stewart Donald said:\n\nI think the fans should have a say on whether they are comfortable with it. My gut feel is that even if we didn't consult with them, the vibe I get is that they aren't particularly attached to the name of the stadium.

The Calgary and Edmonton Trail was established as several trails ran south from a fur trade post that had been established at Fort Edmonton prior to 1800. The northern portion of the route between Calgary and Edmonton was traveled by David Thompson in 1800. The more modern trail was blazed by John McDougall in 1873 as far as Morley and extended to Calgary two years later.  Development of the trail allowed mail service between Calgary and Edmonton in July 1883.\nBy 1930, the entire present-day alignment of Highway\u00a02 through to the British Columbia west of Grande Prairie had already been established as the Sunshine Trail.\n It was a gravelled highway that ran from the US border at Carway directly through Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer and Edmonton to Clyde where it became a dirt road. North of Clyde, it was the only highway that extended north into the Peace Country, bending east to Athabasca then northwest to Peace River. A secondary dirt road proceeded southwest to Dunvegan and the current terminus at Grande Prairie.\nWhen Alberta highways first received numbers, the present-day Highway\u00a02 was originally designated as Highway\u00a01. When the major east\u2014west route through Calgary that had been previously designated as Highway\u00a02 was assigned to the Trans-Canada Highway, the province's major north\u2014south route became Highway\u00a02.

Many cultures have a story about how a deity exacted punishment upon previous inhabitants of their land, causing their doom.\nAn example of divine retribution is the story found in many cultures about a great flood destroying all of humanity, as described in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu Vedas, or Book of Genesis (6:9\u20138:22), leaving one principal 'chosen' survivor. In the first example, it is Utnapishtim, and in the last example Noah. References in the Quran to a man named Nuh (Noah) who was commanded by God to build an ark also suggest that one man and his followers were saved in a great flood.\nOther examples in Hebrew religious literature include the dispersion of the builders of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1\u20139), the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:20\u201321, 19:23\u201328) (Quran 7:80\u201384), and the Ten Plagues visited upon the ancient Egyptians for persecuting the children of Israel (Exodus, Chapters 7\u201312). Similarly, in Greek mythology, the goddess Hera often became enraged when her husband, Zeus, would impregnate mortal women, and would exact divine retribution on the children born of such affairs. In some versions of the myth, Medusa was turned into her monstrous form as divine retribution for her vanity; in others it was a punishment for being raped by Poseidon.\nThe Bible refers to divine retribution as, in most cases, being delayed or \"treasured up\" to a future time. Sight of God's supernatural works and retribution would militate against faith in God's Word. William Lane Craig says, in Paul\u2019s view, God\u2019s properties, his eternal power and deity, are clearly revealed in creation, so that people who fail to believe in an eternal, powerful creator of the world are without excuse. Indeed, Paul says that they actually do know that God exists, but they suppress this truth because of their unrighteousness.\nSome religions or philosophical positions have no concept of divine retribution, nor posit a God being capable of or willing to express such human sentiments as jealousy, vengeance, or wrath. For example, in Deism and Pandeism, the creator does not intervene in our Universe at all, either for good or for ill, and therefore exhibits no such behavior. In Pantheism (as reflected in Pandeism as well), God is the Universe and encompasses everything within it, and so has no need for retribution, as all things against which retribution might be taken are simply within God. This view is reflected in some pantheistic or pandeistic forms of Hinduism, as well.", "The barracks is located on Woodcock Road, adjacent to the ancient Battlesbury Camp hill fort, and was first occupied by the Welch Regiment in 1965.\nOn 9 December 2005 the Barracks was taken over by the Duke of Wellington's Regiment on their return to the UK from Belfast Barracks in Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany, as their permanent UK base.\nIn December 2004, as part of the re-organisation of the infantry, it was announced that the Duke of Wellington's Regiment would be amalgamated with the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire and the Green Howards, all Yorkshire-based regiments in the King's Division, to form the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalion of the new Yorkshire Regiment.

The latter was considered to be Michigan's school song during the 1890s and early 1900s.\n\nThe current fight song, \"The Victors\", was composed by Louis Elbel, a student at the University of Michigan's School of Music, after watching Michigan's 12\u201311 victory over Chicago in 1898.  Elbel began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. Elbel's lyric, \"Champions of the West\", refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history.  Elbel later recalled:\n\"We were crazed with joy. We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me quite suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898.\"\n\nElbel's march, originally known as \"The Victor's March\", debuted in the spring of 1899.  On April 8, 1899, John Philip Sousa gave a concert at University Hall and performed a rendition of Elbel's new song. In May 1899, The Michigan Alumnus published an article touting the song:\nLouis Elbel, who is making a wide reputation as a clever musician and composer, has just published a new piece entitled The Victor's March. It is dedicated to the foot-ball team of '98, and is unusually stirring. Sousa played it at his recent concert here, and it has been performed on several other occasions. The following loyal words go with the music, and Ann Arbor is ringing with them: 'Hail to the victors valiant, Hail to the conquering heroes, Hail, hail to Michigan, The champions of the West.'\"", "After the destruction caused by the 1996 bombing, the city had a chance to reinvent itself.

Classic designs evolved in each country: Dadant hives and Langstroth hives are still dominant in the US; in France the De-Layens trough-hive became popular and in the UK a British National hive became standard as late as the 1930s although in Scotland the smaller Smith hive is still popular. In some Scandinavian countries and in Russia the traditional trough hive persisted until late in the 20th century and is still kept in some areas. However, the Langstroth and Dadant designs remain ubiquitous in the US and also in many parts of Europe, though Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all have their own national hive designs. Regional variations of hive evolved to reflect the climate, floral productivity and the reproductive characteristics of the various subspecies of native honey bee in each bio-region.\nThe differences in hive dimensions are insignificant in comparison to the common factors in all these hives: they are all square or rectangular; they all use movable wooden frames; they all consist of a floor, brood-box, honey super, crown-board and roof. Hives have traditionally been constructed of cedar, pine, or cypress wood, but in recent years hives made from injection molded dense polystyrene have become increasingly important.\nHives also use queen excluders between the brood-box and honey supers to keep the queen from laying eggs in cells next to those containing honey intended for consumption. Also, with the advent in the 20th century of mite pests, hive floors are often replaced for part of (or the whole) year with a wire mesh and removable tray.\nIn 2015 the Flow Hive system was invented in Australia by Cedar Anderson and his father Stuart Anderson, allowing honey to be extracted without expensive centrifuge equipment.", "The Corniche (or Corniche Road) is located in the city of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

Following the Treaty of Paris, the newborn nation was granted fishing rights on the Grand Banks. Several families took advantage of the new opportunity and began to build large fishing schooners. Soon, the schooners built in the 1790s gave way to larger brigs and eventually three-masted ships. As several merchant families began to amass large fleets, shipyards and other ancillary industries flourished and Duxbury prospered. By the 1840s, Duxbury boasted about 20 shipyards and produced an average of ten large sailing vessels per year.\nThe largest industry in Duxbury was owned by Ezra Weston, who came to be known as \"King Caesar\" due to his success and influence. Weston began building small vessels in 1764 and soon became famous for his successful merchant fleet. His son, Ezra Weston II, who inherited his father's kingly sobriquet, would bring the industry to its height. Lloyd's of London recognized Weston as the owner of the largest fleet in America, and this judgment was confirmed by Daniel Webster in a speech in 1841. His empire, a fore-runner of vertical integration, dominated the town. The King Caesar House is now a museum owned by the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society.\nThe shipbuilding era in Duxbury ended as quickly as it began. By the 1850s, sailing vessels were made obsolete by other modes of transportation such as steamships and railroads. While other Massachusetts towns grew, Duxbury went into a long economic decline.\nThere was, however, a silver lining. By the 1870s, Duxbury's rural character and unspoiled bay began to attract summer visitors. Duxbury soon gained a reputation as an idyllic summer resort. With the 1871 completion of the Duxbury & Cohasset Railroad, large numbers of city-folk from Boston could pay $1.50 for a round-trip ticket and enjoy Duxbury's refreshing environment. Boarding houses sprang up everywhere. The Miles Standish Hotel on the Nook soon became enormously popular. The Myles Standish monument, completed in 1898, was a result of this tourist influx.\nThis pattern continued in Duxbury well into the 20th century. It was not until the construction of Route 3 that transportation to Boston became expedient and the town's population rose further with the arrival of thousands of year-round residents.", "By the 1870s, people from Littoral zone that came to Buenos Aires by train, had to navigate on Sarmiento River to Tigre, where the Ferrocarril del Norte de Buenos Aires (FCN) carried them to the centre of the city.

The urban structure of the center has retained most of its original design, with narrow, twisting streets and blocks formed by rows of attached buildings. The Medieval town grew around a castle or fortified place (Thoranum castrum).

His first foray into the genre was a supporting role in the 1944 B-movie When Strangers Marry, about newlyweds and a New York City serial killer. Undercurrent, another of Mitchum's early noir films, featured him as a troubled, sensitive man entangled in the affairs of his brother (Robert Taylor) and his brother's suspicious wife (Katharine Hepburn). John Brahm's The Locket (1946) featured Mitchum as bitter ex-boyfriend to Laraine Day's femme fatale. Raoul Walsh's Pursued (1947) combined Western and noir styles, with Mitchum's character attempting to recall his past and find those responsible for killing his family. Crossfire (also 1947) featured Mitchum as a member of a group of World War II soldiers, one of whom kills a Jewish man. It featured themes of anti-Semitism and the failings of military training. The film, directed by Edward Dmytryk, earned five Academy Award nominations.\nFollowing Crossfire, Mitchum starred in Out of the Past (also called Build My Gallows High), directed by Jacques Tourneur and featuring the cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca.

The arrest was the result of a sting operation designed to capture other Hollywood partiers as well, but Mitchum and Leeds did not receive the tipoff. After serving a week at the county jail (he described the experience to a reporter as being \"like Palm Springs, but without the riff-raff\"), Mitchum spent 43 days (February 16 to March 30) at a Castaic, California, prison farm. Life  photographers were permitted to take  photos of him mopping up in his prison uniform. The arrest inspired the exploitation film She Shoulda Said No! (1949), which starred Leeds. The conviction was later overturned by the Los Angeles court and district attorney's office on January 31, 1951, after being exposed as a setup.\nDespite, or because of, Mitchum's troubles with the law and his studio, his films released immediately after his arrest were box-office hits. Rachel and the Stranger (1948) featured Mitchum in a supporting role as a mountain man competing for the hand of Loretta Young, the indentured servant and wife of William Holden. In the film adaptation of John Steinbeck's novella The Red Pony (1949), he appeared as a trusted cowhand to a ranching family. He returned to film noir in The Big Steal (also 1949), where he reunited with Jane Greer in an early Don Siegel film.", "The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the Museumplein (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former World's fair. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large Rijksmuseum. In front of the Rijksmuseum on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail & Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated several large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A parking garage can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.\nThe Rijksmuseum possesses the largest and most important collection of classical Dutch art.\nIt opened in 1885. Its collection consists of nearly one million objects. The artist most associated with Amsterdam is Rembrandt, whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece The Night Watch is one of the top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like Bartholomeus van der Helst, Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, Albert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael and Paulus Potter. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of decorative art. This ranges from Delftware to giant doll-houses from the 17th century. The architect of the gothic revival building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10-year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on 13 April 2013 and the Rijksmuseum has remained the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2\u00a0million visitors in 2016 and 2.16\u00a0million in 2017.\nVan Gogh lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a museum dedicated to his work. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by Gerrit Rietveld. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like The Potato Eaters and Sunflowers, are in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the second most visited museum in Amsterdam, not far behind the Rijksmuseum in terms of the number of visits, being approximately 2.1\u00a0million in 2016, for example.\nNext to the Van Gogh museum stands the Stedelijk Museum. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of modern art. The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like Piet Mondriaan, Karel Appel, and Kazimir Malevich. After renovations lasting several years the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called 'The Bathtub' due to its resemblance to one.\nAmsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the Verzetsmuseum (Resistance Museum), the Anne Frank House, and the Rembrandt House Museum, to the very large, like the Tropenmuseum (Museum of the Tropics), Amsterdam Museum (formerly known as Amsterdam Historical Museum), Hermitage Amsterd", "Once Chuck Peddle had taken over engineering at Commodore, he convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were already a dead end and that they should turn their attention to home computers. Peddle packaged his single-board computer design in a metal case, initially with a keyboard using calculator keys, later with a full-travel QWERTY keyboard, monochrome monitor, and tape recorder for program and data storage, to produce the Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor). From PET's 1977 debut, Commodore would be a computer company.\nCommodore had been reorganized the year before into Commodore International, Ltd., moving its financial headquarters to the Bahamas and its operational headquarters to West Chester, Pennsylvania, near the MOS Technology site. The operational headquarters, where research and development of new products occurred, retained the name Commodore Business Machines, Inc. In 1980 Commodore launched production for the European market in Braunschweig (Germany).\nBy 1980, Commodore was one of the three largest microcomputer companies and the largest in the Common Market. The company had lost its early domestic-market sales leadership, however; by mid-1981 its US market share was less than 5%, and US computer magazines rarely discussed Commodore products. BYTE stated of the business computer market that \"the lack of a marketing strategy by Commodore, as well as its past nonchalant attitude toward the encouragement and development of good software, has hurt its credibility, especially in comparison to the other systems on the market\". The author of Programming the PET/CBM (1982) stated in its introduction that \"CBM's product manuals are widely recognized to be unhelpful; this is one of the reasons for the existence of this book.\"\nCommodore reemphasized the US market with the VIC-20. The PET computer line was used primarily in schools, where its tough all-metal construction and ability to share printers and disk drives on a simple local area network were advantages, but PETs did not compete well in the home setting where graphics and sound were important. This was addressed with the VIC-20 in 1981, which was introduced at a cost of US$299 and sold in retail stores. Commodore bought aggressive advertisements featuring William Shatner asking consumers \"Why buy just a video game?\" The strategy worked and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units. A total of 2.5 million units were sold over the machine's lifetime and helped Commodore's sales to Canadian schools. In another promotion aimed at schools (and as a way of getting rid of old unsold inventory), some PET models labeled \"Teacher's PET\" were given away as part of a \"buy 2 get 1 free\" promotion.\nIn 1982, Commodore introduced the Commodore 64 as the successor to the VIC-20. Thanks to a well-designed set of chips designed by MOS Technology, the Commodore 64, (also referred to as C64), possessed remarkable sound and graphics for its time and is often credited with starting the computer demo scene. Its US$595 price was high compared with that of the VIC-20, but it was still much less expensive than any other 64K computer on the market. Early C64 advertisements boasted, \"You can't buy a better computer at twice the price.\" Australian adverts in the mid-1980s used a tune speaking the words \"Are you keeping up with the Commodore? Because the Commodore is keeping up with you.\"\nIn 1983, Tramiel decided to focus on market share and cut the price of the VIC-20 and C64 dramatically, starting what would be called the \"home computer war\". TI responded by cutting prices on its TI-99/4A, which had been introduced in 1981. Soon there was an all-out price war involving Commodore, TI, Atari, and practically every vendor other than Apple Computer. Commodore began selling the VIC-20 and C64 through mass-market retailers such as K-Mart, in addition to traditional computer stores. By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped somewhere around 22 million C64s, making the C64 the best selling computer of all time.\nAt the June 1983 Consumer Electroni", "The geology on Douglas Island consists of a belt of volcanic greenstones next to Stephens Passage, which alternate with slate before the transitioning into a belt of slate next to the Gastineaux Channel.

Regal made his debut on 2 March episode of NXT, teaming with Sheffield in a losing effort against Matt Hardy and Justin Gabriel. On 13 April episode of NXT, Regal won his first match on the show, defeating former pupil Daniel Bryan. On the 10 May episode of NXT, Sheffield was eliminated from the competition.\nRegal was mostly involved in lower-card feuds after returning to wrestle on Raw and also regularly appeared on NXT and Superstars. In 2010, he regularly lost tag team matches against Santino Marella while trading wins with Goldust. Regal defeated Darren Young in three matches on Superstars in October and November.\nIn March 2011, Regal became the color commentator for the fifth season of NXT. On 26 April, Regal was drafted to SmackDown as part of the 2011 WWE supplemental draft. On NXT, Regal began a feud with rookie Jacob Novak after Novak taunted him as old and washed up. On the 3 May episode of NXT, Regal was set to face Novak, but Novak's Pro JTG stepped in to replace Novak. While Regal had the match won, Novak interfered, attacking Regal and causing a disqualification. This attack turned Regal face. On the 10 May episode of NXT, Regal defeated Novak by submission to end the feud as Novak was eliminated on the next episode.\nAfter Regal came to the aid of NXT host Matt Striker, saving him from an assault by Darren Young, Young challenged Regal to a match on 6 September episode of NXT and Regal duly defeated Young. On 13 September episode of NXT, Regal teamed with Striker against JTG and Darren Young in a losing effort. On 10 November episode of Superstars held in England, Regal was pranked when his old \"Real Man's Man\" theme song was played, then lost to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Daniel Bryan, but both wrestlers showed respect after the match. On 15 February 2011 episode of NXT Redemption, Regal temporarily took charge as NXT host from Matt Striker to set up matches on the show, which led to him being made NXT's official match coordinator two weeks later. After being appointed as an authority figure, Regal had issues with NXT's perennial troublemakers, Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks while Maxine attempted to influence him to get her off NXT.\nIn 2011, Regal also acted as a color commentator for Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) matches and it was during this time he began a feud with Dean Ambrose after an unprovoked attack by Ambrose on Regal, setting up a match between the two on 6 November episode of FCW, where Regal viciously attacked Ambrose's left arm and pinned Ambrose. Following the loss to Regal, Ambrose became obsessed about wanting a rematch and regularly taunted Regal by using Regal's finishing moves to win matches. A rematch was scheduled as the main event for the final episode of FCW on 15 July. The match began with Regal viciously attacking Ambrose's injured left arm, but Ambrose rammed Regal into the ring post to badly disorientate him. Then Ambrose ruthlessly kneed Regal's head into an exposed turnbuckle, causing Regal to bleed from the ear and the match was then ruled a no contest. After the match, Regal stared down Ambrose, then applauded him and turned his head to allow Ambrose to deliver the Knee Trembler. Afterwards, the FCW locker room stormed the ring to separate Ambrose from a fallen Regal while commentators questioned whether Regal would ever be able to wrestle again. He continued to work as a color commentator for NXT after FCW was rebranded as NXT.\nIn 2012, Regal wrestled multiple live event dates wrestling against the likes of Santino Marella and Wade Barrett. Regal ended up on both the winning and losing side. At Over the Limit, Regal participated in a 20-man battle royal, but he was ultimately unsuccessful. In late 2012, Regal played the role of Sheamus' friend in Sheamus' rivalry against Big Show, where he was repeatedly attacked by Show. Regal was featured on 6 November episode of SmackDown in Birmingham, England in which Regal teamed with Sheam", "A Midrash read Exodus 25:2 to say \"that they take Me as an offering\" and thus to tell how God gave the Torah to Israel and said to them: \"You are taking Me.\"\nReading God's words in Exodus 25:2, \"accept gifts for Me from every person whose heart so moves him,\" the Mekhilta of Rabbi Simeon deduced that each and every Israelite was so rich from having stripped the Egyptians (as reported in Exodus 12:36) that each Israelite had the wherewithal to erect the Tent of Meeting, with all its vessels, all of its golden hooks, boards, wooden bars, columns, and pedestals.\nA Midrash taught that Exodus 25:3 calls for offerings of gold, silver, and brass for the construction of the Tabernacle, because gold symbolizes Babylon, of which Daniel 2:32 says, \"As for that image, its head was of fine gold\"; silver symbolizes the Medes, of which Daniel 2:32 says, \"Its breast and its arms were of silver\"; and brass refers to Greece, of which Daniel 2:32 says, \"Its belly and thighs were of brass.\" But the Bible makes no mention of iron in the construction either of the Tabernacle or of the Temple in Jerusalem, because iron symbolizes Rome, which destroyed the Temple.\nThe Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the turquoise wool (techeilet, \u05ea\u05b0\u05db\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea) listed in Exodus 25:4 came from an animal called a chilazon that resembled the sea in color and a fish in shape, that appeared once every 70 years, and whose blood was used to dye the expensive blue thread.\nRabbi Elai said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish (Resh Lakish) that Rabbi Meir used to maintain that the \u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05d7\u05b8\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05dd, techashim (sometimes translated \"sealskins\" or \"dolphin skins\") listed in Exodus 25:5 came from an animal called a tachash that lived in the time of Moses. It was a separate species, and the Sages could not decide whether it was a wild beast or a domestic animal. It had one horn on its forehead, and it came to Moses providentially just for the occasion. Moses made the Tabernacle's covering, and then the tachash disappeared. The Gemara taught that the tachash was multicolored.\nThe Tosefta deduced from Exodus 25:5 (and the principle that the law prohibits doing on the Sabbath all that was done to build the Tabernacle) that one who tans hides on the Sabbath violates the commandment to keep the Sabbath.\nThe Tosefta taught that invalidity of either the onyx stones or the stones to be set described in Exodus 25:7 invalidated the other.\nThe Tosefta taught that Exodus 25:8 provided the commandment that Exodus 39:43 said that Moses fulfilled.\nA Midrash explained with a parable God's instruction to build a Tabernacle. A king had only one daughter, who married another king. When the son-in-law king wished to return to his country and take his wife with him, the father king told him that he could neither part with his daughter nor tell her husband not to take her, as she was now his wife. The father king thus asked the son-in-law king the favor that wherever the son-in-law king would go to live, he would have a chamber ready for the father king to dwell with them, for he could not bear to leave his daughter. Thus, God told Israel that God had given Israel a Torah from which God could not part, and yet God also could not tell Israel not to take the Torah. Thus, God asked the Israelites to make for God a house wherein God might sojourn wherever the Israelites went, and thus Exodus 25:8 says, \"And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.\"\nRabbi Eleazar ben Azariah taught that the words of Exodus 25:8, \"And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them,\" demonstrate that so great is labor that God's Presence did not dwell among the Israelites until they had performed the labor of making the sanctuary.\nThe Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael asked why in Exodus 25:8 God commanded, \"Let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them,\" when in Isaiah 66:1, God said, \"The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that you may build for Me?\" The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the purport of the commandment was simply to enable the Israelites to r", "Glass on fins are fins that are permanently connected to the surfboard through fiberglass.  This type of fin was mainly used on older model surfboards.  Glass on fins are broken easily and are hard to repair.  You rarely see these types of fins today because a different type of fin has replaced them.\nRemovable Fin Systems The most common types of fins used today, removable fins are surfboard fins that can be unscrewed from the surfboard and be replaced by different fins or be moved about the board for a different setup in maneuverability and stability. In the early '90s, three Australian surfers invented the fin control system (FCS). Since its global release in 1994 FCS has become the industry standard; providing elite athletes and everyday surfers an abundance of fin designs and a platform to change the performance of their surfboard by changing fins. The system also streamlined the surfboard manufacturing process by making it easier to install fins into boards and repair damaged fins. The leading competitor to FCS fins is Futures fins. Using a single larger fin box, the manufacturer claims the fins provide a stronger connection and more closely approximate the feeling of a glass on fin.

The Habsburg recognized the independence of Serbia and established diplomatic relations in  1874, supported by the Treaty of Berlin (1878).\nHungarian suppression of Serbian revolts during the 1848 Revolutions were not opposed by the Habsburg rulers.  Serbian claims were not recognized by Hungary was eventually placated with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, further angering Serbian nationalists.  One notable flare-up between the two countries was the 1906-1909 economic conflict known as the Pig War which occurred simultaneously with the diplomatic and military crisis over the Austrian annexation of Bosnia.  Ultimately, the tensions between the two countries could not withstand the strain of Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Bosnian Serbs in 1914.  Following the July Crisis, Austria invaded Serbia to punish it for allegedly supporting the assassins. The resulting war eventually destroyed the Austro-Hungarian Empire, leaving a shrunken First Austrian Republic as a rump state. Serbia annexed much of the former Austrian holdings in the Balkans to become the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Its name derives from the Irish language C\u00faige Uladh (pronounced \"Kooi-gah UH-loo\"), meaning \"fifth of the Ulaidh\", named for the ancient inhabitants of the region.\nThe province's early story extends further back than written records and survives mainly in legends such as the Ulster Cycle.\nThe archaeology of Ulster, formerly called Ulandia, gives examples of \"ritual enclosures\", such as the \"Giant's Ring\" near Belfast, which is an earth bank about 590\u00a0feet (180 m) in diameter and 15\u00a0feet (4.5 m) high, in the centre of which there is a dolmen.\nThe Boyne and its tributary the Blackwater were the traditional southern boundary of the province of Ulster and appear as such in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge. According to historian Francis John Byrne the Ulaid 'possibly still ruled directly in Louth as far as the Boyne in the early seventh century' when Congal C\u00e1ech made a  bid for the kingship of Tara. In 637, the Battle of Moira, known archaically as the Battle of Magh Rath, was fought by the Gaelic High King of Ireland Domhnall II against his foster son King Congal C\u00e1ech of Ulster, supported by his ally Domhnall the Freckled (Domhnall Brecc) of Dalriada. The battle was fought near the Woods of Killultagh, just outside the village of Moira in what would become County Down. It was allegedly the largest battle ever fought on the island of Ireland, and resulted in the death of Congal and the retreat of Domhnall Brecc.\nIn early medieval Ireland, a branch of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the province of Ailech, gradually eroded the territory of the province of Ulaidh until it lay east of the River Bann. The Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain would make T\u00edr E\u00f3ghain (most of which forms modern County Tyrone) their base. Among the High Kings of Ireland were \u00c1ed Findliath (died 879), Niall Gl\u00fandub (died 919), and Domnall ua N\u00e9ill (died 980), all of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain. The province of Ulaidh would survive restricted to the east of modern Ulster until the Norman invasion in the late 12th century. It would only once more become a province of Ireland in the mid-14th century after the collapse of the Norman Earldom of Ulster, when the O'Neills who had come to dominate the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill stepped into the power vacuum and staked a claim for the first time the title of \"king of Ulster\" along with the Red Hand of Ulster symbol. It was then that the provinces of Ailech, Airgialla, and Ulaidh would all merge largely into what would become the modern province of Ulster.\nDomnall Ua Lochlainn (died 1121) and Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn (died 1166) were of this dynasty. The Meic Lochlainn were in 1241 overthrown by their kin, the clan \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (see O'Neill dynasty). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's were from then on established as Ulster's most powerful Gaelic family.\nThe \u00d3 Domhnaill (O'Donnell) dynasty were Ulster's second most powerful clan from the early thirteenth-century through to the beginning of the seventeenth-century.

He also married Taka, the daughter of the sh\u014dgun's personal retainer Iwajiro Mihashi. In order that his headmastery of the Jikishinkage-ry\u016b would not interfere with his duties to the sh\u014dgun, his student Matsuoka Katsunosuke was temporarily placed in charge of the school.\nBy 1863, Sakakibara was a head keeper at Edo Castle and received a stipend of 300 ry\u014d per year.

When Roosevelt died, plans to establish this museum and to save the ships were abandoned. On 19 October 1945, Hartford was towed to the Norfolk Navy Yard and classified as a relic.

served as Spain's representative at the Congress of Vienna (1814\u20131815).  Labrador did not successfully advance his country's diplomatic goals at the conference.  These goals included restoring the Bourbons (who had been deposed by Napoleon) to the thrones of Spain's old Italian possessions, and reestablishing control over Spanish South American colonies, which had risen in revolt during the Napoleonic invasion of Spain.\nThe Marquis of Labrador is almost universally condemned by historians for his incompetence at the Congress.  One standard Spanish history textbook condemns him for \"...his mediocrity, his haughty character, and his total subordination to the whims of the king's inner circle, by which he achieved nothing favorable.\"  Paul Johnson calls him \"a caricature Spaniard who specialized in frantic rages, haughty silences and maladroit demarches.\"\nLabrador was born in Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara, and studied at the traditionally conservative University of Salamanca.  He received a bachelor's degree in law at the age of twenty-seven and an advanced degree four years later, and was named a judge on the Audiencia of Seville in 1793.  In August 1798, Labrador was sent as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Florence by Charles IV of Spain to accompany Pius VI (r.1775-1799) in exile, when this pontiff was forced to become a prisoner of the French, following his refusal to surrender his temporal sovereignty to the French armies commanded by General Louis Alexandre Berthier.\nAt the death of Pius VI, Labrador was named Minister Plenipotentiary to the Papal States, and later served at Florence, capital of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Etruria.\nThe liberal deputies of the national assembly based in C\u00e1diz (1810\u20131813) took him to be one of their own, and gave him the vital post of Minister of State, a decision they would quickly regret: \"[Labrador was] dim, prolix, of pride and arrogance that trod the limits of fatuity, and of peculiar pedantry.\"  But he was no liberal.  He assisted Ferdinand VII in abolishing the liberal constitution of 1812, and was awarded with the duty of representing Spain at the peace conferences of Paris and Vienna, with the full rank and title of Ambassador.\nAt the Congress, the Marquis of Labrador was outmaneuvered by experienced diplomats such as Talleyrand and Metternich.\nLabrador's entreaties on behalf of the devolution of the former Spanish possession of Louisiana from the United States were roundly ignored.  The Austrians blocked plans that would have made Spain a special ally of the Holy See; the British likewise rejected Spain's territorial claims against Portugal.  The British particularly were exasperated with their Spanish ally and her representative.  \"It is somewhat singular in itself,\" Castlereagh would write, \"that the only two Courts with which we find it difficult to do business are those of the Peninsula.\"  In his opinion of Labrador, the Duke of Wellington, Castlereagh's replacement at Vienna and an experienced judge of truculent hidalgos, was more direct: \"The most stupid man I ever came across.\"  Labrador was a man, according to the Spanish Minister of State Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda de Le\u00f3n y Pizarro \"...of little amiability [and of] few or no dinners or gatherings.\"  And in this apogee of drawing-room diplomacy, this was fatal.\nLabrador could in fact rely neither on his choleric personality to repair any relations, personal or diplomatic, nor on a salary that his cash-strapped government never paid him, to arrange any social gatherings at his residence on the Minoritten Platz, the Palais P\u00e1lffy.  \"He did not even figure,\" his biographer assures us, \"as a protagonist in any of the many amorous adventures [that occurred during the Congress]\"; the most exciting social event Labrador seems to have attended was a wax figures production in the Christmastide of 1814.\nSpain did not sign the Final Act of the Congress of June 9, 1815, for Labrador's proposal to attach reservations to the act concerning the rights of the Italian Bourb", "This is a list of fictional stories in which politics features as an important plot element.

Located within the John Day River basin and managed by the National Park Service, the park is known for its well-preserved layers of fossil plants and mammals that lived in the region between the late Eocene, about 45\u00a0million years ago, and the late Miocene, about 5\u00a0million years ago. The monument consists of three geographically separate units: Sheep Rock, Painted Hills, and Clarno.\nThe units cover a total of 13,944 acres (5,643\u00a0ha) of semi-desert shrublands, riparian zones, and colorful badlands. About 210,000 people visited the park in 2016 to engage in outdoor recreation or to visit the Thomas Condon Paleontology Center or the James Cant Ranch Historic District.\nBefore the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19th\u00a0century, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and gathered roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and a few small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.\nAveraging about 2,200 feet (670\u00a0m) in elevation, the monument has a dry climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) to winter lows below freezing. The monument has more than 80 soil types that support a wide variety of flora, ranging from willow trees near the river to grasses on alluvial fans to cactus among rocks at higher elevations. Fauna include more than 50 species of resident and migratory birds. Large mammals like elk and smaller animals such as raccoons, coyotes, and voles frequent these units, which are also populated by a wide variety of reptiles, fish, butterflies, and other creatures adapted to particular niches of a mountainous semi-desert terrain.", "Ratan Rajput is an Indian television actress.

Wells wrote The Croquet Player, which uses croquet as a metaphor for the way in which people confront the very problem of their own existence.\nLewis Carroll featured a nonsense version of the game in the popular children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: a hedgehog was used as the ball, a flamingo as the mallet, and playing cards as the hoops.\nIn the Thursday Next series of novels, notably Something Rotten, Jasper Fforde depicts an alternative world in which croquet is a brutal mass spectator sport.\nThe cover of the 1971 Genesis album Nursery Cryme shows Cynthia, a character in the song \"Musical Box\" holding a croquet mallet with a few heads on the playing field including another character of the song Henry's head that she removed with said mallet.\nIn the 1980s geography game Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?, one of the characters, Fast Eddie B, is described as a \"world class croquet player\", and two other gang members, Ihor Ihorovich and Scar Graynolt, also play the sport.\nIn the 1988 film Heathers, Winona Ryder and her friends, the Heathers, are depicted as playing croquet, though at the beginning, the Heathers are playing croquet to hit someone on the head. Croquet mallets also feature in the publicity posters for Heathers: The Musical.", "Latin script, also known as Roman script, is a set of graphic signs (script) based on the letters of the classical Latin alphabet. This is derived from a form of the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet used by the Etruscans. Several Latin-script alphabets exist, which differ in graphemes, collation and phonetic values from the classical Latin alphabet.\nThe Latin script is the basis of the International Phonetic Alphabet and the 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.\nLatin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any writing system and is the\nmost widely adopted writing system in the world (commonly used by about 70 percent of the world's population). Latin script is used as the standard method of writing in most Western, Central, as well as in some Eastern European languages, as well as in many languages in other parts of the world.", "When the helix circumference is near the wavelength of operation, the antenna operates in axial mode.  This is a nonresonant traveling wave mode, in which instead of standing waves, the waves of current and voltage travel in one direction, up the helix.   Instead of radiating linearly polarized waves normal to the antenna's axis, it radiates a beam of radio waves with circular polarisation along the axis, off the ends of the antenna.  The main lobes of the radiation pattern are along the axis of the helix, off both ends.  Since in a directional antenna only radiation in one direction is wanted, the other end of the helix is terminated in a flat metal sheet or screen reflector to reflect the waves forward.\nIn radio transmission, circular polarisation is often used where the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas cannot be easily controlled, such as in animal tracking and spacecraft communications, or where the polarisation of the signal may change, so end-fire helical antennas are frequently used for these applications.  Since large helices are difficult to build and unwieldy to steer and aim, the design is commonly employed only at higher frequencies, ranging from VHF up to microwave.\nThe helix of the antenna can twist in two possible directions: right-handed or left-handed, the former having the same form as that of a common corkscrew.  The 4-helix array in the first illustration uses left-handed helices, while all other illustrations show right-handed helices. In an axial-mode helical antenna the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the emitted wave.  Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarized radiation it emits is often described in ways that appear to be ambiguous.  However, Kraus (the inventor of the helical antenna) states \"The left-handed helix responds to left-circular polarisation, and the right handed helix to right-circular polarisation (IEEE definition)\" .  The IEEE defines the sense of polarisation as \"the sense of polarization, or handedness ... is called right handed (left handed) if the direction of rotation is clockwise (anti-clockwise) for an observer looking in the direction of propagation\"   Thus a right-handed helix radiates a wave which is right-handed, the electric field vector rotating clockwise looking in the direction of propagation.\nHelical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarized signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarized antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarized signals, and vice versa.\nThe dimensions of the helix are determined by the wavelength \u03bb of the radio waves used, which depends on the frequency.  In order to operate in axial-mode, the circumference should be equal to the wavelength. The pitch angle should be 13 degrees, which is a pitch distance (distance between each turn) of 0.23 times the circumference, which means the spacing between the coils should be approximately one-quarter of the wavelength (\u03bb/4).  The number of turns in the helix determines how directional the antenna is: more turns improves the gain in the direction of its axis at both ends (or at 1 end when a ground plate is used), at a cost of gain in the other directions. When C<\u03bb it operates more in normal mode where the gain direction is a donut shape to the sides instead of out the ends.\nTerminal impedance in axial mode ranges between 100 and 200\u00a0ohms, approximately\nwhere C is the circumference of the helix, and \u03bb is the wavelength. Impedance matching (when C=\u03bb) to standard 50 or 75 ohm coaxial cable is often done by a quarter wave stripline section acting as an impedance transformer between the helix and the ground plate.\nThe maximum directive gain is approximately:\nwhere N is th", "Gertrude /\u02c8\u0261\u025c\u02d0rtru\u02d0d/ is the largest known crater on Uranus's moon Titania. It is about 326\u00a0km across, 1/5 of Titania's diameter. It is named after the mother of Hamlet in William Shakespeare's play Hamlet.  Features on Titania are named after female Shakespearean characters.\nThe crater rim of Gertrude is elevated by 2\u00a0km over the crater floor. In the center of the crater there is a large dome, which resulted from the uplift of the surface immediately after the impact. The dome has the diameter of about 150\u00a0km and is 2\u20133\u00a0km high. The rim and dome are low for crater with such a large diameter indicating that the relief has relaxed since the impact. The surface of the dome has only few superimposed smaller craters, which means that it was modified later.", "Gilbert C.

He died in Liberty Hill, Texas, aged 86.", "The medial axis of an object is the set of all points having more than one closest point on the object's boundary.  Originally referred to as the topological skeleton, it was introduced by Blum as a tool for biological shape recognition.\nIn mathematics the closure of the medial axis is known as the cut locus.\nIn 2D, the medial axis of a subset S which is bounded by planar curve C is the locus of the centers of circles that are tangent to curve C in two or more points, where all such circles are contained in S.  (It follows that the medial axis itself is contained in S.)\nThe medial axis of a simple polygon is a tree whose leaves are the vertices of the\npolygon, and whose edges are either straight segments or arcs of parabolas.\nThe medial axis together with the associated radius function of the maximally inscribed discs is called the medial axis transform (MAT). The medial axis transform is a complete shape descriptor (see also shape analysis), meaning that it can be used to reconstruct the shape of the original domain.\nThe medial axis is a subset of the symmetry set, which is defined similarly, except that it also includes circles not contained in S.  (Hence, the symmetry set of S generally extends to infinity, similar to the Voronoi diagram of a point set.)\nThe medial axis generalizes to k-dimensional hypersurfaces by replacing 2D circles with k-dimension hyperspheres. The 2D medial axis is useful for character and object recognition, while the 3D medial axis has applications in surface reconstruction for physical models, and for dimensional reduction of complex models.\nIf S is given by a unit speed parametrisation , and  is the unit tangent vector at each point. Then there will be a bitangent circle with center c and radius r if \nFor most curves, the symmetry set will form a one-dimensional curve and can contain cusps. The symmetry set has end points corresponding to the vertices of S.", "The Divjak\u00eb-Karavasta National Park is strategically located in the southeastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. It lies mostly between latitudes 40\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 N and longitudes 19\u00b0 and 29\u00b0 E. The park occupies 222.30\u00a0km\u00b2 (85.83\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Fier County in southwestern Albania comprising a substantial section of the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast. The most adjacent town to the park is Divjak\u00eb located in the east from the park entrance. The approximately 35 kilometres long coastline is relatively flat, running from the mouth of Shkumbin to the mouth of Seman.\nThe park's mandate includes the protection of the lagoon of Godulla and Karavasta and the estuaries of Shkumbin in the north and Seman in the south. The bodies of water of the park are chiefly affected by the inflow of those rivers, which bring sand, silt and shells, which in turn form numerous small islands and narrow spits. Due to these deposits, the lagoon bottom is relatively smooth and flat with a low salinity and a high amount of biomass that considerably affects the colour of the lagoons.\nThe river of Shkumbin begins at the eastern part of the mountains of Valamara in Kor\u00e7\u00eb County. At Gryka e Shkumbinit, the river, which until then was trapped in a narrow valley, breaks through the Skanderbeg Mountains and enters the coastal region until it reaches the northern part of the park, where it flows into the Adriatic Sea. However, the river of Seman begins at the confluence of the Osum River and Devoll River as well in Kor\u00e7\u00eb County.

Around the same year, Goodwill launched the first nonprofit Internet auction site in the United States. By 2006, Goodwill Industries International had a network of 207 member organizations in the United States, Canada, and 23 other countries. As of July 2011, there are 164 full Goodwill members in the United States and Canada. These are each independent social enterprises that operate their own regional Goodwill retail stores and job training programs. Morgan Memorial Goodwill Industries, Boston, is the enterprise operated in Boston, where Goodwill was founded.\nThe clothing and household goods donated to Goodwill are sold in more than 3,200 Goodwill retail stores, on its Internet auction site shopgoodwill.com, as well on eBay by a number of its regional stores. Most of the items on shopgoodwill.com are items that are considered collectible or more valuable. Each regional store will ship out what they deem valuable so that the items will be purchased for fair market value. Antiques, collectibles, jewelry, comic books, furniture, and even automobiles are found on this website. The revenues fund job training and other services to prepare people for job success. Examples of Goodwill's presence on eBay are Goodwill Industries of Maine, Seattle, San Francisco, and many other locations. Goodwill locations that operate on eBay research donated items for higher profit than could be brought in-store, and instead list those items on eBay for auction. \nIn 2010, through their involvement in Goodwill's programs, more than 170,000 people were placed into employment. They earned $2.7 billion in salaries and wages, and as tax-paying citizens, they contributed to the community. Goodwill also generates income to help businesses and the federal government fill gaps caused by labor shortages, time constraints, and limited space or equipment. Local Goodwill branches train and employ contract workers to fill outsourced needs for document management, assembly, mailing, custodial work, grounds keeping and more. Goodwill claims that more than 84 percent of its total revenue is used to fund education and career services and other critical community programs. Also in 2010, Goodwill provided people with training careers in industries such as banking, IT and health care, as well as offering English-language training, education, transportation, and child care services.\nWhen merchandise cannot be sold at a normal Goodwill store, it is taken to a 'Goodwill Outlet' or 'Bargain Store.' Items are mostly sold by weight, with prices ranging from $0.49 to $1.69 per pound, depending on the location. The wide selection and massive discounts on a variety of household goods typically attract a fervent following of regular customers, some of whom make a full-time living buying and re-selling goods. There are also many vendors who buy this merchandise in bulk, and they send the merchandise to third-world countries.\nCharity Watch rates the Goodwill Industries an \"A\".\nIn January 2016, Goodwill Industries of Toronto, Eastern, Central and Northern Ontario closed its 16 stores and 10 donation centres after 80 years of operations, citing cash problems.

Additionally, Greece is Albania's main foreign investor, having invested more than 400 million dollars in Albania, Albania's second largest trading partner, with Greek products accounting for some 21% of Albanian imports, and 12% of Albanian exports coming to Greece, and Albania's fourth largest donor country, having provided aid amounting to 73.8 million euros.\nGreece is a staunch supporter of the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Republic of Albania, and since Albania's NATO entry in May 2009, Albanian-Greek relations have been developing on all fronts. The relations, particularly after the election victory of Edi Rama in 2013, have seen massive improvement and warming of relations between the two nations for a short period of time, with the Albanian Chief of Foreign Policy, Ralf Gjoni, describing the diplomatic relations between two countries as \"excellent\". However, during the year 2014, only a year after Rama's election, Albania and Greece relations deteriorated and became increasingly strained, due to Rama's refusal of the agreement that defined the Maritime borders and set the Exclusive Economic Zone between the two countries, which Albania's previous government signed with Greece in 2009. Despite the difficulties in the relations between the two countries, Greece, is regarded as Albania's most important European Union ally and partner.\nBoth states are co-operating in many fields, such as political, judicial, energy and tourism. There are regular high-level visits between the two countries, and frequent contacts between the two countries' governments, parliaments and the local authorities on various matters concerning individual sectors and mutual interests. Big projects currently in running between the two countries include the touristic development of the Ionian coastline shared between the two countries, and the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). Official meetings between the two governments and the parliaments are frequent and the armies of both states are conducting co-training in a regular basis as part of the NATO training programme for the modernization of the Albanian Army Forces.\nUnder the Greek EU Presidency, Albania, on 24 June 2014 was granted the official EU candidate status which coincides with the 10th anniversary of the \"Agenda 2014\" proposed by the Greek Government for boosting the integration of Albania and all the Western Balkan states into the European Union.", "The Etrich Sport-Taube was a one off, single engine, one seat monoplane, built in Czechoslovakia in 1929.", "A trough was located over the Gulf of Mexico on September\u00a08, which interacted with a weakening cold front to produce a low pressure area, and eventually a tropical depression on September\u00a012.

By late on September\u00a014, Ethel reached peak winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km), presenting a well-defined eye. Operationally, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), making Ethel a Category 5 hurricane, although a reanalysis in 2016 downgraded Ethel to a Category\u00a03. Cooler air caused a period of rapid weakening, and Ethel moved ashore near Pascagoula, Mississippi with sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). The storm gradually weakened after moving inland, before eventually dissipating over southern Kentucky on September\u00a017.\nIn Louisiana, the outer bands of the storm produced light rainfall and hurricane-force winds, though no damage was reported in that state. Offshore Mississippi, rough seas inundated Horn Island and split Ship Island. Tropical storm force winds in the southern portion of the state littered broken glass, trees, and signs across streets in Pascagoula, as well as down power lines, which caused some residents to lose power.

The control of elite Maya commodities trade from inland to coastal regions was pivotal in creating and reinforcing political rule. Accessibility to obsidian, seashells, stingray spines, master crafted ceramics, jadeite, cacao, textiles, quetzal feathers, and gold were limited to the top of the Maya social strata. Presence of these commodities at sites both inland and coastal suggests connections to elite persons and to larger regional city centers, whether through trade or occupational usage.  Not all coastal sites were necessarily occupied primarily as settlements, instead acting as de facto ports of trade because of their strategic locations at river mouths. The major trade site of Moho Cay in southern Belize is one such specific port, where high quality chert and obsidian from interior obsidian outcrops in the Guatemalan highlands was amassed for distribution down the Belize River to large cities, like Tikal, during the Classic Period. \nWild Cane Cay on the northern Belizean coast also operated as a trade port focused on foreign obsidian distribution. Seashells, particularly conch and spondylus, were prized for both ritual usage and elite adornment. Modern strontium isotope analysis provides a means for sourcing shells trade to interior Maya settlements. Likewise, stingray spines imported from the coast played a major role in royal Maya bloodletting rituals for communing with ancestors and deities.\nThere is evidence that gold and jade, either as a raw material or a manufactured product, was produced in only limited quantities in the Maya regional sphere. Many instances of these two rare elite goods traveled by long-distance trade from the Ishmo-Columbian region outside of the Maya cultural sphere. The goldworks and jade originated in Costa Rica and Ecuador and likely traded up through coastal Caribbean routes, as interior routes were largely impassable.

The area around the Vermont Avenue campus was developing issues including rising crime and urban decay, and racial tensions had arisen that led to the 1965 Watts Riots. In December 1970, student activists threatened to burn down the campus, even setting small fires in three buildings. They later occupied the Academic Life building, leading to a standoff with the Los Angeles Police Department that was defused by negotiations with vice president William S. Banowsky.\nBefore the worst of the tensions began, President Young had already begun to look for suburban sites to expand the university's footprint. In 1966, a committee was formed to look at potential locations, including sites in Westlake Village and Calabasas. Pepperdine favored the Westlake Village location until the Adamson-Rindge family, who owned hundreds of acres near Malibu, offered to donate 138 acres (56\u00a0ha) and to sell 58.7 adjacent acres. Despite concerns over building costs on the mountainous site, the school decided to move forward based on its prime location and potential for raising donations, accepting the land in Malibu in 1968. Construction began on April 13, 1971 and the new campus opened for student enrollment in September 1972. The campus and many of its buildings were planned by Los Angeles\u2013based architect and urban planner William Pereira, who had also designed the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and much of the University of Southern California. The construction of the Malibu campus was made possible largely by gifts from Blanche Seaver, the wife of Frank R. Seaver and heir of his oil-drill manufacturing fortune, who donated to Pepperdine more than $160 million over her lifetime. The undergraduate college was officially named after Seaver in 1975.\nThe university retained and continued to expand its original Vermont Avenue campus, building a new academic building there in 1970, and redesigning the curriculum to serve its more urban setting. Much of the undergraduate liberal arts program, however, moved to the new Malibu campus. In the decade to come, the Vermont Avenue campus transitioned away from its residential model, and in 1981 the Vermont Avenue campus was sold to Crenshaw Christian Center, whose minister, Frederick K.C.

The line's first section from Bridgetown to Carrington was inaugurated on 20 October 1881. The first train needed approximately 40 minutes for the one-way trip.\nAfter derailments, the passenger trains were temporarily cancelled after one week, as additional construction work had to be done. The public was informed that up to then only trials had been carried out, to test the track and to establish, how well the track could be used. Additional work was required at the terminus, and some sections of the track had to be levelled.\nThe complete line up to Belleplaine was officially inaugurated in 1883 with a festive banquet. The dignitaries of the maiden voyage \"wondered, why the railway should have ended so abruptly among barren sand hills,\" but they were apparently impressed by the meal, which had been prepared for the occasion. According to a contemporary report \"nothing was heard for sometime but the rattle of knives and forks and the popping of soda-water and Ginger Ale corks, which with some good sound Claret and a little Bass, cooled by abundance of ice, formed the staple beverages.\"\nInitially, the railway was operated with great success, due to large traffic of sugar, freight and passengers. The owners did not re-invest their earnings into the maintenance of their assets, so that the track deteriorated in the 1890s by corrosion, wear, rain and floodings and was in the need of a complete overhaul.\nDue to large storms in December 1896, long sections of the track became unusable because of erosion and flooding and had to be rebuilt completely. In the subsequent two years until 1898, the rail track was re-gauged to the new gauge of 762\u00a0mm (2 feet 6 inch) by the internationally recognised railway specialist Everard Calthrop. New Baldwin locomotives and passenger cars were imported from the United States. The success was only short-lived, as the operators went into financial difficulties again when the governmental subsidies faded out. The railway was temporarily closed in 1904, while the liquidators tried to find another investor.\nA new railway company was founded in 1905 with the name The Barbados Light Railway Company Limited and took-over the operation. It expanded the services by installing a branch to Crane. Crane's Hotel placed advertisements for the passenger trains from Bushy Park, which stopped near to the hotel. But the company went into dire straits again in 1906, as there was only very limited passenger traffic and the goods transport was not profitable enough, to keep the company running. The government subsidies phased-out again in 1914, and the company went bankrupt.\nThe Government of Barbados took over the railway in 1916. After conducting some urgently needed repairs, it started initially with goods transport and with effect from 1917 it started again to transport passengers. Over the years, the railway deteriorated again. Even after buying a new train and overhauling the existing ones, the track itself became unreliable and caused some derailments. The buildings in Bridgetown required also some immediate refurbishment.\nThe railway line had a total of 98 bridges. Ernest Biffin, the General Manager of the Railway, explained in the 1920s that the railway was unique for two reasons: It had the most severe curve  of any line he knew and one of the steepest gradients of any railway in the world. Just beyond Three Houses at Consetts Cutting the railway descended a 1 in 33 grade from the escarpment to sea level. Local people believe that curves were placed in the track because the railway company from England did not build lines less than 21 miles long. More likely this could be the reason, why it was extended into the sandy hills of Bellplaine.\nThe insufficient maintenance raised again some concerns in the early 1930s. The locomotive sheds and depots for the wagons had become unstable beyond repair, and the locomotives should have been stripped down and overhauled completely.

It became a centre for the social life of students at the Canterbury College. The property included a small theatre, a vast garden, and fireworks displays for entertainment. Bickerton's idea for the property was to create a new form of society based around his socialist beliefs, however this social experiment was discontinued after several years. From 1903 the property was turned more into a theme park to provide family income, with a zoo, 7,000 person amphitheatre, conservatory, aquariums, cinema, medicine and fireworks factories, and mock naval battles on a man-made lake. It attracted hundreds of thousands of people over the coming years.

It began at the Nevada\u2013California border in an area of Pahrump Valley near Cathedral Canyon, part of the historic Hidden Hills Ranch south of Pahrump, traveling north to Pahrump over Hidden Hills Ranch Road. From there, it continued north over present-day SSR\u00a0160 to meet SR\u00a05, which was absorbed into and redesignated US\u00a095 on January 1, 1940.\nBy 1976, the section from Pahrump to US 95 was designated as part of the newly-created SR\u00a0160. The section from the California border to Pahrump remained as SR\u00a016 until it was removed by 1982 and is now designated Old Route 16.

The highway was moved a short distance to the south between Valley View Boulevard and Las Vegas Boulevard, realigning the southeastern terminus with East Windmill Lane at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard. The project also reconstructed the ramps of the aging interchange, allowing for better traffic flow to and from I-15.

The two leading examples are the Archaic building at Poggio Civitate and another at Acquarossa (Zone F); both are 6th-century or earlier.  Both have sets of buildings round a courtyard, which use stone, at least in the foundations, roof tiles, and elaborate decorations in architectural terracotta.  Their size is exceptional for their early date. One obvious possible function is as palatial dwellings; another is as civic buildings, acting as places for assembly, and commemoration of aspects of the community.

Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada swore fealty and paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, while Muslim sources never described the relationship as such. Muhammad I, for instance, on occasion declared his fealty to other Muslim sovereigns.\nYusuf's predecessor, Muhammad IV, sought help from the Marinid Sultanate to counter a threat by an alliance of Castile and the powerful Granadan commander Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, who supported a pretender to the throne in a civil war. In exchange for the Marinid alliance, he had to yield Ronda, Marbella, and Algeciras. Subsequently, the Marinid\u2013Granadan forces captured Gibraltar and fended off a Castilian attempt to retake it, before signing a peace treaty with Alfonso XI of Castile and Abu al-Hasan Ali of the Marinids the day before his assassination.  While the actual killing of Muhammad IV was carried out by a slave named Zayyan, the instigators were Muhammad's own commanders, Abu Thabit ibn Uthman and Ibrahim ibn Uthman. They were the sons of Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, who died in 1330, and his successors as the leaders of the Volunteers of the Faith, the corps of North Africans fighting on the Iberian Peninsula for Granada. According to Ibn Khaldun, the two brothers decided to kill Yusuf due to his closeness to the Marinid Sultan Abu al-Hasan\u2014their political enemy\u2014while according to Castilian chronicles it was because of the friendly way he treated Alfonso XI at the conclusion of the siege.\nAs a result of Muhammad's cessions to the Marinids and the taking of Gibraltar, the Marinids had sizeable garrisons and territories on traditionally Granadan lands in Al-Andalus (the Muslim-controlled part of the Iberian Peninsula). Their control of Algeciras and Gibraltar\u2014two ports of the Strait of Gibraltar\u2014gave them ability to move troops easily between North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula.

Berger argues that this is how the U.S. Constitution was historically interpreted as well as how the draftsmen of the 14th Amendment intended for this Amendment to be interpreted. Berger also argues that the sole purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize the Civil Rights Act of 1866. (Berger rejects the use of statements by critics of the Fourteenth Amendment to advance a broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment by arguing that these statements were made to make the Fourteenth Amendment look terrifying in order to increase the odds that this Amendment be rejected and defeated.) Specifically, the purpose of that Act was to tear down the Black Codes in the post-Civil War Southern U.S. and to give the freedmen basic rights such as freedom of contract, the right to sue and be sued, to travel and work wherever they please, and to buy, sell, and own property. Berger argues that, in the view of its draftsmen, the 1866 Civil Rights Act did not require U.S. states to allow African-Americans to serve on juries, to vote, to intermarry with White people, or to go to the same schools that White people went to. Thus, Berger argues that numerous U.S. Supreme Court decisions based on the Fourteenth Amendment have been wrongly decided since they were decided contrary to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions include the 1880 case Strauder v. West Virginia (which stated that African-Americans cannot be prohibited from serving on juries), the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education (which struck down school segregation), the 1960s one person, one vote cases such as Reynolds v. Sims, and the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia (which struck down bans on interracial marriage).\nBerger also criticizes the argument made by Alexander Bickel, William Van Alstyne, and others that the 14th Amendment's language was meant to be open-ended in order to give future generations a large amount of discretion in determining how to apply the 14th Amendment's principles to their own times. Berger argues that the \"open-ended language\" theory lacks any historical basis whatsoever and that, in any case, any intentions that existed but were not disclosed to the American people before they ratified a constitutional amendment certainly have no value and shouldn't be used as a basis for interpreting this amendment. In Berger's view, the ideas of substantive due process as well as the incorporation of the Bill of Rights (against the states) are both contrary to the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment. In regards to incorporation of the Bill of Rights, Berger argues that the views of John Bingham and Jacob Howard in regards to this issue were unorthodox (Bingham and Howard both stated that the 14th Amendment would apply the first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights against the states) and that most Republicans in the 39th United States Congress (which proposed and passed the 14th Amendment) did not share Bingham's and Howard's views on this issue. As support for his position, Berger points out that none of the Republicans who spoke about the 14th Amendment on the campaign trail leading up to the 1866 elections ever said or even suggested that the 14th Amendment would apply any of the amendments in the Bill of Rights against the states and that court rulings shortly after the 14th Amendment's ratification in 1868 continued to hold that the Bill of Rights was inapplicable against US states (as opposed to the US federal government--against which the Bill of Rights was always held to be applicable). Finally, Berger defends the holding in the notorious 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson and argues that the reason that \"Plessy has become a symbol of evil[] ... is because we impose 'upon the past a creature of our own imagining' instead of looking to 'contemporaries of the events we are studying.'\" Berger argues that \"Plessy merely reiterated what an array of courts had been holding for fifty years\"--st", "The 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season was the highest level of college football competition in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\nThe regular season began on August 30, 2007 and ended on December 1, 2007.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1969, and is included in the Col. Elias Earle Historic District.\nUntil the end of the 20th century, the house was widely believed to have been built about 1810 for Congressman Elias T. Earle; but Earle never owned the property. The house is more likely to have been built c. 1829-1833 by one Samuel Green or possibly as late as 1834 after the land had been acquired by Elias Drayton Earle, half nephew and son-in-law of Elias T. Earle.\nIn 1856 James A. David bought the house and 35 acres. His son, Charles A.

David described it as a \"rambling old affair\" with a framework \"mortised and put together with wooden pegs....The ceilings were so high, the only way it could have been heated in winter would have been to set it on fire.\"\nIn December 1927, the house was bought by Mary Chevillette Simms Oliphant, granddaughter of 19th-century novelist William Gilmore Simms and the author in her own right of more than a dozen books, including a once widely adopted public school history of South Carolina. In the 1920s Oliphant had Greenville architect William Riddle Ward renovate the house to what she believed was its original Federal style, demolishing one wing, removing the colonnaded porch, and adding three rooms to the second floor. Some original features were preserved, including hand-hewn timbers, brick and rock supports, six-paneled doors, a hand-carved mantelpiece, and a Palladian window in the second story.

In his Affirmations, Hubbard later recorded: \"Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you.\"  \nAfter 77 days on the sick list, it was finally determined that he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. In October 1943, he asked to be transferred to landing craft and was sent on a six-week training course at the Naval Small Craft Training Center in San Pedro, California. He was then ordered in December 1943 to join the crew of USS\u00a0Algol, an attack cargo ship, to assist with the ship's fitting out and crew training in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was commissioned in July 1944 with Hubbard aboard in the role of Navigation and Training Officer. The next two months were occupied with training exercises off the California coast in preparation for the ship's envisaged departure in September for the western Pacific theater of operations.\nHubbard, however, applied instead to undertake a three-month training course in military administration at the School of Military Government, a faculty that had been established on the campus of Princeton University, but was not part of the University itself, although Hubbard later asserted that he had been a Princeton student. His commanding officer approved the detachment and gave Hubbard a generally good fitness report, rating him to be \"of excellent personal and military character\" though he \"is very temperamental and often has his feelings hurt\". On September 27, a curious incident occurred aboard USS Algol; the ship's deck log records that Hubbard reported that he had discovered \"an attempt at sabotage\" consisting of a Coke bottle filled with gasoline with a cloth wick inserted, concealed among the ship's cargo. A few hours later Hubbard was ordered to depart the ship and proceed to Princeton.\nIn later years, Hubbard asserted that the 1955 film Mister Roberts was based on his service aboard USS Algol with Henry Fonda's eponymous character being based on Hubbard himself and James Cagney's tyrannical character based on the commander of Algol. In a February 1956 lecture, Hubbard told Scientologists: \"There was a story made about that vessel [Algol], by the way. It was called Mister Roberts. You may have seen this picture or read the book.\" According to a Church of Scientology publication,\nAt the end of the war, having been relegated because of his physical condition to the amphibious forces in the Pacific, he had the adventures which are reported on the screen in \"Mister Roberts\". \"The Bucket\" of that motion picture, stage play, and the novel is actually the A.K.A. 54, the U.S.S. Algol. The captain so brutally characterized in the picture is actually Lieutenant Commander Axton P.  [sic] Jones. L. Ron Hubbard as \"Mister Roberts\" was with the ship less than a year, however, and contrary to the script, was not killed at Okinawa.\nGeorge Malko comments that \"this [claim] has never been substantiated\" and notes that the author of the original novel, Thomas Heggen, \"would only say about Roberts: \"He is too good to be true, he is a pure invention.\"\" The novel was reportedly \"loosely based on [Heggen's] service on the USS\u00a0Virgo\".\nAt the conclusion of his course at the School of Military Government, Hubbard failed to pass his examinations \u2013 finishing only mid-way down the class list \u2013 and did not qualify for an overseas posting. He was posted in January 1945 to the Naval Civil Affairs Staging Area in Monterey, California, for further training but, as he later acknowledged, he became depressed and fell ill with a duodenal ulcer. He reported sick with stomach pains in April 1945 and spent the remainder of the war on the sick list as a patient in Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California.

This included the ROK Army, US Army and British Army forces operating in Korea. It also included support for the ships of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Netherlands which were also contributing to the effort. When the Eighth Army became operational in Korea, this logistical function was assumed by Eighth Army Rear which remained behind in Yokohama, Japan. This dual role of the Eighth Army\u2014that of combat in Korea and of logistical support for all troops fighting there\u2014led to the designation of that part of the army in Korea as Eighth United States Army in Korea. This situation existed until August 25. On that date the Far East Command activated the Japan Logistical Command with Major General Walter L. Weible in command. It took over the logistical duties previously held by Eighth Army Rear. It also assumed responsibility of the movement of refugees and prisoners of war.\nThe supplies needed to support the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan.  Whatever could be obtained from stocks in Japan or procured from Japanese manufacturers was obtained there. In early July 1950, Japanese manufacturers began making antitank mines and on July 18 a shipment of 3,000 of them arrived by boat at Pusan. The equipment and ordnance supplies that was available to the United States forces in Korea in the first months of the war was largely due to the \"roll-up\" plan of the Far East Command which had been in effect for some time before the outbreak of hostilities. It called for the reclamation of ordnance items from World War II in the US Pacific island outposts and their repair or reconstruction in Japan. This plan had been conceived and started in 1948 by Brigadier General Urban Niblo, the senior Ordnance Officer of the Far East Command.

Black men who had escaped to the country or were securely hidden to avoid coming under control of the provost guards, returned to the city.\nAt 5 a.m. on September 5th, 706 volunteers reported for duty and were put to work.

When they were done, hundreds of acres of forests had been cleared and miles of rifle pits were dug.  They had built forts, magazines, and miles of military roads and breastworks along the border with Northern Kentucky between Fort Thomas and Bromley. The fortifications were built far enough away from Cincinnati that they could not shell the city. \nThere were a total of 1,000 black men who served in defence of the city. There were the 700 men who built the fortifications and another 300 men who performed work in military camps, in the city, and on gun boats. The Brigade had one fatality: Joseph Johns who was killed when a tree fell on him accident on September 17, 1862. \nDickson was presented with an engraved sword by the members of the brigade. He thanked them by stating, \"...you have labored cheerfully and effectively. Go to your homes with the consciousness of having performed your duty.....and bearing with you the gratitude and respect of all honorable men.\" The most significant threat to Cincinnati from the Confederates during the Civil War occurred in 1862 and the fortifications built by the Black Brigade are credited with thwarting that threat.\t \nBecause of racial segregation, the city would not allow black men to join the all-white volunteer militia. The Black Brigade was never intended to serve as armed soldiers, and saw no combat during the war.

Slaves, especially those brought from Africa, provided most of the work force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut brazilwood.\nIn contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions, which had several viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la Plata and New Granada, the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in the coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working sugar plantations and mines. The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to export products. Brazil's sugar age, with the development of plantation slavery, merchants serving as middle men between production sites, Brazilian ports, and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the Caribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain. Gold and diamonds were discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial era. Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative capital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export products' importance.\nUnlike Spanish America, which fragmented into many republics upon independence, Brazil remained a single administrative unit under a monarch, giving rise to the largest country in Latin America. Just as European Spanish and Roman Catholicism were a core source of cohesion among Spain's vast and multi-ethnic territories, Brazilian society was united by the Portuguese language and Roman Catholic faith.

There is speculation that the first title signified that he grew up in the royal nursery as a prince of a vassal territory, or perhaps was the son of a lesser wife or concubine of the pharaoh.

A section of the route, known locally as 'Barnard's Cutting', had been filled with refuse and had to be excavated before the track could be restored. The excavation of 3,000 tons of waste did not return the trackbed to its original level, resulting in a severe 1 in 29 gradient that had not existed when the line was originally in use.

The fuzes were designed as a pivoting lever, and downward motion of the lid caused the lever to pull back a striker, compressing a striker spring until the pivoting action moved the lever enough to release the striker. The striker then impacted a blank cartridge, firing it, triggering a detonator charge, followed by the main charge.\nUsed primarily at junctions and road-blocks, because of the width of coverage it provided, the mine sensitivity could be adjusted between approximately 20 pounds of triggering pressure to 500 pounds by inserting small wooden blocks under the rim of the lid.", "Texas Tech University was founded in 1923, is a public, coeducational, doctoral/research university, and is the system flagship.

Najib Razak has said Malaysia could attain developed country status much earlier from the actual target in 2020, adding the country has two program concept such as Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme. According to a HSBC report, Malaysia will become the world's 21st largest economy by 2050, with a GDP of $1.2\u00a0trillion (Year 2000 dollars) and a GDP per capita of $29,247 (Year 2000 dollars). The report also says \"The electronic equipment, petroleum, and liquefied natural gas producer will see a substantial increase in income per capita. Malaysian life expectancy, relatively high level of schooling, and above average fertility rate will help in its rapid expansion\". Viktor Shvets, the managing director of Credit Suisse, has said \"Malaysia has all the right ingredients to become a developed nation\".\nIn the 1970s, the predominantly mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, with a high level of investment, has led the country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.\nInternational trade, facilitated by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca, and manufacturing are the key sectors. Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources, and petroleum is a major export. Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin, rubber and palm oil in the world. Manufacturing has a large influence in the country's economy, although Malaysia's economic structure has been moving away from it. Malaysia remains one of the world's largest producers of palm oil.\nIn an effort to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own.

Historically, primary mirrors were quite thick in order to maintain the correct surface figure in spite of forces tending to deform it, like wind and the mirror's own weight.  This limited their maximum diameter to 5 or 6 metres (200 or 230\u00a0inches), such as Palomar Observatory's Hale telescope.\nA new generation of telescopes built since the 1980s uses thin, lighter weight mirrors instead. They are too thin to maintain themselves rigidly in the correct shape, so an array of actuators is attached to the rear side of the mirror. The actuators apply variable forces to the mirror body to keep the reflecting surface in the correct shape over repositioning. The telescope may also be segmented into multiple smaller mirrors, which reduce the sagging due to weight that occurs for large, monolithic mirrors.\nThe combination of actuators, an image quality detector, and a computer to control the actuators to obtain the best possible image, is called active optics.\nThe name active optics means that the system keeps a mirror (usually the primary) in its optimal shape against environmental forces such as wind, sag, thermal expansion, and telescope axis deformation. Active optics compensate for distorting forces that change relatively slowly, roughly on timescales of seconds. The telescope is therefore actively still, in its optimal shape.", "Unlike the adjacent streets, the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm developed out of a historic corduroy road (German: Damm) laid out by the Brandenburg margraves to reach the Grunewald hunting lodge, which was erected about 1542 at the behest of the Hohenzollern elector Joachim II Hector. Although the exact date of the building is unknown, an unnamed causeway leading from the Stadtschloss through the swampy area between the settlements of Charlottenburg (then called Lietzow) and Wilmersdorf to Grunewald is already depicted in a 1685 map. The name Churf\u00fcrsten Damm was first mentioned between 1767 and 1787.\nFrom 1875 the former bridlepath was embellished as a boulevard with a breadth of 53\u00a0m (174\u00a0ft) on the personal initiative of chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who also proposed the building of the Grunewald mansions colony at its western end. In 1882, Ernst Werner von Siemens presented his Elektromote trolley bus concept at an experimental track near Halensee station. The nearby Lunapark opened in 1909, then Europe's largest amusement park, modelled on Coney Island, where boxer Max Schmeling won his first title of a German Lightheavyweight Champion in 1926. After a long period of decline the park was finally closed in 1933. Large parts are today covered by the Stadtautobahn.\nIn 1913 the new Marmorhaus cinema opened. A number of major film premieres were held here during the silent era.\nEspecially during the \"Golden Twenties\" the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm area of the \"New West\" was a centre of leisure and nightlife in Berlin, an era that ended with the Great Depression and the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933. The shops and businesses owned by Jewish tradespeople became the target of several pogroms, culminating in the \"Reichskristallnacht\" of 9 November 1938. In World War II the boulevard suffered severe damage from air raids and the Battle of Berlin.\nNevertheless, after the war rebuilding started quickly, and when Berlin was separated into East and West Berlin, the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm became the leading commercial street of West Berlin in its Wirtschaftswunder days. It was therefore the site of protests and major demonstrations by the German student movement, while on 11 April 1968 spokesman Rudi Dutschke was shot in the head while leaving the office of the Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm No. 140.\nAfter German reunification the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm had to compete with central places like Potsdamer Platz, Friedrichstra\u00dfe, and Alexanderplatz, which led to the closing of numerous caf\u00e9s and cinemas. It retained the character of a fl\u00e2neur and upscale shopping street as the western continuation of the Tauentzienstra\u00dfe with its large department stores.\nThe globally unique international art project United Buddy Bears was presented in Berlin on the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm during the summer of 2011.", "Cathode rays are so named because they are emitted by the negative electrode, or cathode, in a vacuum tube. To release electrons into the tube, they first must be detached from the atoms of the cathode. In the early cold cathode vacuum tubes, called Crookes tubes, this was done by using a high electrical potential of thousands of volts between the anode and the cathode to ionize the residual gas atoms in the tube.  The positive ions were accelerated by the electric field toward the cathode, and when they collided with it they knocked electrons out of its surface; these were the cathode rays.   Modern vacuum tubes use thermionic emission, in which the cathode is made of a thin wire filament which is heated by a separate electric current passing through it. The increased random heat motion of the filament knocks electrons out of the surface of the filament, into the evacuated space of the tube.\nSince the electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the negative cathode and attracted to the positive anode. They travel in straight lines through the empty tube. The voltage applied between the electrodes accelerates these low mass particles to high velocities. Cathode rays are invisible, but their presence was first detected in early vacuum tubes when they struck the glass wall of the tube, exciting the atoms of the glass and causing them to emit light, a glow called fluorescence. Researchers noticed that objects placed in the tube in front of the cathode could cast a shadow on the glowing wall, and realized that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode. After the electrons reach the anode, they travel through the anode wire to the power supply and back to the cathode, so cathode rays carry electric current through the tube.\nThe current in a beam of cathode rays through a vacuum tube can be controlled by passing it through a metal screen of wires (a grid) between cathode and anode, to which a small negative voltage is applied. The electric field of the wires deflects some of the electrons, preventing them from reaching the anode. The amount of current that gets through to the anode depends on the voltage on the grid. Thus, a small voltage on the grid can be made to control a much larger voltage on the anode. This is the principle used in vacuum tubes to amplify electrical signals. The triode vacuum tube developed between 1907 and 1914 was the first electronic device that could amplify, and is still used in some applications such as radio transmitters. High speed beams of cathode rays can also be steered and manipulated by electric fields created by additional metal plates in the tube to which voltage is applied, or magnetic fields created by coils of wire (electromagnets). These are used in cathode ray tubes, found in televisions and computer monitors, and in electron microscopes.", "The red-faced spider monkey has long, black hair and a red or pink face that is bare except for a few short, white hairs.

During her first stint in San Francisco in 1963, Joplin met and briefly lived with Jae Whitaker, an African American woman whom she had met while playing pool at the bar Gino & Carlo in North Beach. Whitaker broke off their relationship because of Joplin's hard drug use and sexual relationships with other people. Whitaker was first identified by name in connection with Joplin in 1999, when Alice Echols' biography Scars of Sweet Paradise was published.\nJoplin also had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship with Peggy Caserta. They first met in November 1966 when Big Brother performed at a San Francisco venue called The Matrix. Caserta was one of 15 people in the audience. At the time, Caserta ran a successful clothing boutique in the Haight Ashbury. Approximately a month after Caserta attended the concert, Joplin visited her boutique and said she could not afford to buy a pair of jeans that was for sale. Caserta took pity on her and gave her a pair for free. Their friendship was platonic for more than a year. Before it moved to the next level, Caserta was in love with Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew, and sometime during the first half of 1968 she traveled from San Francisco to New York to flirt with him. He did not want a serious relationship with her, and Joplin sympathized with Caserta's disappointment.\nThe Woodstock movie includes 37 seconds of Joplin and Caserta walking together before they reached the tent where Joplin waited for her turn to perform. By the time the festival took place in August 1969, both women were intravenous heroin addicts.\nAccording to Caserta's book Going Down With Janis, Joplin introduced her to Seth Morgan in Joplin's room at the Landmark Motor Hotel on Tuesday evening, September 29, 1970. Caserta \"had seen him around\" San Francisco but had not met him before. All three of them agreed to reunite three nights later, on Friday night, for a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois in Joplin's room. Caserta saw Joplin briefly the next day, Wednesday, again in Joplin's room, when Caserta accommodated her new Los Angeles friend Debbie Nuciforo, age 19, an aspiring hard rock drummer who wanted to meet Joplin. Nuciforo was stoned on heroin at the time, and the three women's encounter was brief and unpleasant. Caserta suspected that the reason for Joplin's foul mood was that Morgan had abandoned her earlier that day after having spent less than 24 hours with her.\nCaserta did not see nor communicate by phone with Joplin again, although she later claimed she had made several attempts to reach her by phone at the Landmark Motor Hotel and at Sunset Sound Recorders. Caserta and Seth Morgan lost touch with each other, and each decided independently to abandon Joplin on Friday night, October 2. Joplin mentioned her disappointment (over both of her friends' bailing out of their m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois) to her drug dealer on Saturday while he was selling her the dose of heroin that killed her, as Caserta later learned from the drug dealer.\nBiographer Myra Friedman commented in her original version of Buried Alive (1973):\nGiven the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization.

Transcription of this protein was reported to be regulated in response to mitogenic signals through a transcriptional control mechanism involving E2F proteins.", "Charles I introduced a centralized power structure in the 1320s. Stating that \"his words has the force of law\", he never again convoked the Diet. Even his most faithful partisans depended on revenues from their temporary honours, because the king rarely made land grants. This practice ensured the loyalty of the Drugeths, Lackfis, Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyis and other families who emerged in his reign.\nThe king even afforded to grant privileges which contradicted customary law. For instance, he occasionally authorized daughters of noblemen to inherit their fathers' estates, although local customs required that a deceased nobleman's inherited lands were to be transferred to his agnates in lack of a son. Nevertheless, Roman law never replaced customary which gave rise to the appearance of lay officials who possessed \"a good command of Latin and a fair knowledge of common law\" (P\u00e1l Engel).\nCharles I reformed the system of royal revenues and monopolies. For instance, he imposed the \"thirtieth\" (a tax on goods transferred through the kingdom's frontiers), and authorized landholders to retain one third of the income from mines opened in their estates. The new mines produced around 2,250 kilograms (4,960\u00a0lb) of gold and 9,000 kilograms (20,000\u00a0lb) of silver annually, which made up more than 30\u00a0percent of the world's production up until the Spanish conquest of the Americas in the 1490s. However, most profits from the mines were transferred to Italian and South German merchants, because the value of imported fine textiles and other goods always exceeded the price of cattle and wine exported from the kingdom.\nCharles I also ordered the minting of stable golden coins modelled on the florin of Florence. His ban on trading with uncoined gold produced shortage in the European market which lasted until his death in 1342. Thereafter his widow, Elisabeth of Poland transported enormous quantities of gold to Italy in order to promote the claim of their younger son, Andrew to the Kingdom of Naples. Andrew who was Queen Joanna I of Naples's consort was assassinated in 1345. His brother, Louis I of Hungary accused the queen of his murder and led two campaigns against her in 1347 and 1350. Although he twice conquered her kingdom, she regained it on both occasions.\nThe first campaign against Naples was abandoned because of the arrival of the \"Black Death\". In Hungary, fewer locals fell victim to the epidemic than in Western Europe, because the kingdom was still an underpopulated territory with well nourished inhabitants. Indeed, colonization also continued in the 14th century. The new settlers mainly came from Moravia, Poland and other neighboring countries. They were customarily exempted of taxation for 16 years, which is reflected by the lehota (\"lightening\") placenames in present-day Slovakia.\nEarlier distinctions between freemen, serfs and udvornici disappeared in the 14th century, because all peasants had acquired the right to free movement by the 1350s. Most of them cultivated well defined parcels with a hereditary right to use it for a rent in cash and in-kind \"gifts\" due to the landowner. The legal position of \"true noblemen\" was also standardized when the idea of \"one and the same liberty\" was enacted in 1351. For instance, all noblemen received the right to \"adjudicate all offences committed\" by the peasants living in their estates (Martyn Rady).\nMost towns were still dominated by German merchants, but more and more Croat, Hungarian and Slovak peasants arrived from the nearby villages to settle in the towns in the 14th century. Louis I's Privilegium pro Slavis (\"Privilege for the Slavs\") from 1381 was the first indication of official bilingualism in a town. It ensured that the Slovaks in Zsolna (present-day \u017dilina, Slovakia) would enjoy the same privileges as the town's German burghers.\nLouis I who was heir presumptive to Casimir III of Poland assisted the Poles several times against Lithuania and the Golden Horde. The foundation of Moldavia, a Romanian principality east of the Carpathians is also connected to these campaigns. Along the southern fronti", "In Africa, the sap used to create palm wine is most often taken from wild datepalms such as the silver date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), the palmyra, and the jaggery palm (Caryota urens), or from oil palm such as the African Oil Palm (Elaeis guineense) or from Raffia palms, kithul palms, or nipa palms. In part of central and western Democratic Republic of the Congo, palm wine is called malafu. Palm wine tapping is mentioned in the novel Things Fall Apart by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe and is central to the plot of the novel The Palm Wine Drinkard by Nigerian author Amos Tutuola.\nPalm wine plays an important role in many ceremonies in parts of Nigeria such as among the Igbo peoples, and elsewhere in central and western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, and funeral wakes are served generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (Kulosa malafu in Kikongo ya Leta). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.\nIn parts of southeastern Nigeria, namely Igboland, palm wine is locally referred to as \"mmanya ocha\" (literally, \"white drink\"), with \"ngwo\" and \"nkwu\" variants. It plays a very important role in traditional Igbo settings. In Urualla, for instance, and other \"ideator\" towns, it is the drink of choice for traditional weddings. A young man who is going for the first introduction at his in-laws\u2019 house is required to bring palm wine with him. There are varying gallons of palm wine required, depending on the customs of the different regions in Igboland. This culture can be observed in a similar fashion in the neighbouring north-western regions of Cameroon. (North West Region).\nThere are four types of palm wine in the central and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It was Vietnam's first home-grown revolutionary party, established three years before the Indochinese Communist Party. The party advocated socialism, but at the outset there was considerable debate over its other fundamental objectives. Many wanted it to promote worldwide revolution, rather than limiting itself to campaigning for an independent Vietnamese republic; but there were fears that this would lead to accusations of communism, putting off potential Vietnamese supporters who yearned above all for independence. In a bid for moderation, the final statement was a compromise that read:\nThe aim and general line of the party is to make a national revolution, to use military force to overthrow the feudal colonial system, to set up a democratic republic of Vietnam. At the same time we will help all oppressed nationalities in the work of struggling to achieve independence, in particular such neighboring countries as Laos and Cambodia.\nA manifesto released in February 1930 showed that the VNQDD heavily based its rhetoric on appealing to resentment against the system of racial inequality and the French imposition of capitalism. It appealed to the populace to rise up against colonisation and the poor treatment of Vietnamese people. It assailed the French for restricting the Vietnamese people's ability to study, discuss policy and associate, and what it perceived as exploitative capitalist policies that enriched French enterprises while leaving Vietnamese people unhealthy. It criticised the colonial administration, which it saw as corrupt and encouraging low-level Vietnamese bureaucrats to mistreat their compatriots, and said that the ouster to French rule was necessary to stop the \"elimination process\" against the Vietnamese race.\nIn order to attain its primary aim of independence, the VNQDD had three principles by which it intended to operate. The first was nationalism, under which people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam were to be citizens of a sovereign nation. Secondly, democracy was to give citizens the right to vote, impeach elected officials, ratify and abolish laws. The third and final principle was to implement socialist controls on the economy, and restricting capitalism through nationalisation, guaranteed minimum working conditions and land reform. This was ultimately aimed towards reducing income inequality. There had been a debate over the socioeconomic bent of the party when it was formed, with some advocating communism and others private property, but the position reached was not dissimilar from an existing Vietnamese social norm where villagers often owned land communally although social hierarchies still existed. Although the socioeconomic side of the VNQDD agenda was not as heavily promoted at a  high political level as the other two principles, there was a strong push at grassroots level to implement more socialist systems.\nAlthough the VNQDD modelled itself on Sun Yat-sen's Chinese Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang or KMT, later led by Chiang Kai-shek), even down to copying the \"Nationalist Party\" designation, it had no direct relationship with its Chinese counterpart and in fact did not gain much attention outside Vietnam until the Yen Bay mutiny in 1930. However, in elucidating its primary objective of national independence, it did rely ideologically on S\u00fans Three Principles of the People (nationalism, people's welfare and human rights). Like the KMT, it was a clandestine organisation held together with tight discipline. Its basic unit was the cell, above which there were several levels of administration, including provincial, regional and central committees. Also like the KMT, the VNQDD's revolutionary strategy envisaged a military takeover, followed by a period of political training for the population before a constitutional government could take control.\nMost party members were teachers, young people who had been exposed to a western education and political theory,", "Ren\u00e9 II (2 May 1451 \u2013 10 December 1508) was Count of Vaud\u00e9mont from 1470, Duke of Lorraine from 1473, and Duke of Bar from 1483 to 1508.

Despite a historically low turnout of less than 60% of registered voters, the right-wing won a clear mandate, winning nearly 130 MPs, more than 56% of the seats, and just over 50% of the vote. While the People's Party, continuing the trend they began in 2009, earned their best score since 1983, the Social Democrats exceeded the expected result in the opinion polls and won the same number of seats as they did in 2002, when the PSD was led by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso. Of the twenty districts of the country, Pedro Passos Coelho's party won seventeen, including Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Portalegre, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Santar\u00e9m and the Azores, that tend to favor the Socialist Party.\nThe defeat of the PS was severe, as they lost in eleven districts and fell below 30% of the votes cast, a first since the election of 1991. This heavy defeat led Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates to resign as General Secretary of the party on election night. However, it was not the Socialists' worst result, which dated back to 1987 when they polled 30 points behind the Social Democrats. The Socialists were also beaten in Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates district, Castelo Branco, that he dominated since 1995.\nFor the left-wing parties, the result was mixed. On one hand, the Left Bloc faced a huge setback, losing half of its MPs and regaining its 2005 numbers, where they obtained however, one more percentage point in a context of greater participation. As a whole, the Portuguese left-wing parties trails by ten points in support to the right-wing parties, the biggest lead since the absolute majority of the Social Democrat An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva in the 1990s.\nVoter turnout was one of the lowest in Portuguese election history, with just 58% of the electorate casting their ballot on election day.", "In November 1914, film producer William Fox offered to market Gertie the Dinosaur to moving-picture theaters for \"spot cash and highest prices\".  McCay accepted, and extended the film to include a live-action prologue and intertitles to replace his stage patter.  The film successfully traveled the country and had reached the west coast by December.\nThe live-action sequence was likely shot on November 19, 1914.  It features McCay with several of his friends, such as cartoonists George McManus and Tad Dorgan, writer Roy McCardell, and actor Tom Powers; McCay's son Robert had a cameo as a camera-room assistant.  McCay used a bet as a plot device, as he had previously in the Little Nemo film.\nAs the film opens, McCay and friends suffer a flat tire in front of the American Museum of Natural History.

After being ordained in 1831, he became an agent of the American Home Missionary Society in 1833, and settled in Florida, where he taught, among other places, at St. Augustine High School there, and among the local African-American community. Meanwhile, as his appointment to a mission abroad was delayed due to financial circumstances, he also received a medical degree from a medical institution in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1837, and learned Chinese.\nHe was sent to Singapore by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions on 25 May 1838, and remained there until 1841, when he departed for Macao due to his wife's ailing health.

It is also thought that lenticular galaxies exhibit a larger bulge-to-disk ratio than spiral galaxies and this may be inconsistent with simple fading from a spiral. If S0s were formed by mergers of other spirals these observations would be fitting and it would also account for the increased frequency of globular clusters. It should be mentioned, however, that advanced models of the central bulge which include both a general Sersic profile and bar indicate a smaller bulge, and thus a lessened inconsistency.

This tells us that how high y is on the vertical axis depends on what x (the horizontal axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation y = x\u00b2, we know that if x is 1, then y will be 1; if x is 3, then y will be 9; if x is 20, then y will be 400.\nChoose a point A on the curve, and call its horizontal position x. Then choose another point B on the curve which is a little bit farther across than A, and call its horizontal position x + h. It does not matter how much h is, it is a very small number.\nSo when we go from point A to point B, the vertical position has gone from f(x) to f(x + h), and the horizontal position has gone from x to x + h. Now remember that the slope is how much it goes up divided by how much it goes across. So the slope will be:\nIf you bring B closer and closer to A\u2013which means h gets closer and closer to 0\u2013then we get closer to knowing what the slope is at the point A.\nNow let's go back to y = x\u00b2. The slope of this can be determined as follows:\nApplying the binomial theorem which states  we can reduce to:\nSo we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve f(x) = x\u00b2, the derivative f'(x) (marked with an apostrophe) will be 2x at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative.\nLeibniz came to the same result, but called h \"dx\", which means \"a tiny amount of x\". He called the resulting change in f(x) \"dy\", which means \"a tiny amount of y\". Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated.

During the next few months, the southern Central Powers forces advanced over 500 miles further, capturing the whole of Ukraine and some territory beyond.\nGerman operations also continued in the Caucasus and Finland, where Germany assisted the White Finnish forces in the Finnish Civil War. Under the treaty all Russian naval bases in the Baltic except Kronstadt were taken away, and the Russian Black Sea Fleet warships in Odessa were to be disarmed and detained. The Bolsheviks also agreed to the immediate return of 630,000 Austrian prisoners-of-war.\nWith the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Soviet Russia had given up Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine, enabling those territories to develop independently from Russian influence. Germany's intention was to turn these territories into political and territorial satellites, but this plan collapsed with Germany's own defeat within a year. After the German surrender, the Soviets made an attempt to regain lost territories. They were successful in some areas like Ukraine, Belarus and the Caucasus, but were forced to recognize the independence of the Baltic States, Finland, and Poland.\nIn Ukraine Ukrainian troops took control of the Donets Basin in April 1918. In the same month, Crimea was also cleared of the Bolsheviks by Ukrainian troops and the Imperial German Army. On 13 March 1918 Ukrainian troops and the Austro-Hungarian Army had secured Odessa. On 5 April 1918 the German army took control of Yekaterinoslav, and 3 days later Kharkiv. The German/Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were due to the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts.\nIn the Bolshevik government, Lenin consolidated his power; however, fearing the possibility of a renewed German threat along the Baltic, he moved the capital from Petrograd  to Moscow on 12 March.

In order to qualify for this third area, a university had to have at least one internationally recognized academic center of excellence and a new graduate school.\nAfter the first round of selections, LMU Munich was invited to submit applications for all three funding lines: It entered the competition with proposals for two graduate schools and four clusters of excellence.\nOn Friday 13 October 2006, a blue-ribbon panel announced the results of the Germany-wide Excellence Initiative for promoting top university research and education. The panel, composed of the German Research Foundation and the German Science Council, has decided that LMU Munich will receive funding for all three areas covered by the Initiative: one graduate school, three \"excellence clusters\" and general funding for the university's \"future concept\".\nIn January 2012, scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University, published details of the most sensitive listening device known so far.

In April 1948, the airline flew direct international routes from Singapore to Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in Vietnam; Batavia (now Jakarta), Medan and Palembang in Indonesia; and to Bangkok in Thailand via Penang. It also flew a route connecting Penang with Medan.\nThe airline grew rapidly in the next few years, boosted by rising demand for air travel during the post-war period, where flying was no longer a privilege for the very rich. By 12 April 1960, the airline was operating Douglas DC-3s, Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations and Vickers Viscounts on new routes from Singapore to Hong Kong and from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok via Penang.

The game also spread south to Arabia and to India and Tibet.\nAbbasid Baghdad had a large polo ground outside its walls, and one of the city's early 13th century gates, the Bab al Halba, was named after these nearby polo grounds. The game continued to be supported by Mongol rulers of Persia in the 13th century, as well as under the Safavid dynasty. In the 17th century, Naqsh-i Jahan Square in Isfahan was built as a polo field by King Abbas I. The game was also learnt by the neighbouring Byzantine Empire at an early date. A tzykanisterion (stadium for playing tzykanion, the Byzantine name for polo) was built by emperor Theodosius II (r. 408\u2013450) inside the Great Palace of Constantinople. Emperor Basil I (r. 867\u2013886) excelled at it; Emperor Alexander (r. 912\u2013913) died from exhaustion while playing and John I of Trebizond (r. 1235\u20131238) died from a fatal injury during a game.\nAfter the Muslim conquests to the Ayyubid and Mameluke dynasties of Egypt and the Levant, their elites favoured it above all other sports. Notable sultans such as Saladin and Baybars were known to play it and encourage it in their court. Polo sticks were featured on the Mamluk precursor to modern-day playing cards.\nThe game spread to South Asia where it has had a strong presence in the north western areas of present-day Pakistan (including Gilgit, Chitral, Hunza and Baltistan) since at least the 15th\u201316th century. The name polo is said to have been derived from the Balti word \"pulu\", meaning ball. Qutubuddin Aibak, the Turkic slave from Central Asia who later became the Sultan of Delhi in Northern India from 1206 to 1210, suffered an accidental death during a game of polo when his horse fell and he was impaled on the pommel of his saddle. Polo likely travelled via the Silk Road to China where it was popular in the Tang dynasty capital of Chang'an, and also played by women, who wore male dress to do so; many Tang dynasty tomb figures of female players survive. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity, the popularity of polo in Tang China was \"bolstered, no doubt, by the presence of the Sasanian court in exile\".\nA polo-obsessed noblewoman was buried with her donkeys on 6 October 878 AD in Xi\u2019an, China.\nAn archaic variation of polo, regionally referred to as buzkashi or kokpar, is still played in parts of Asia.", "William David Chesarek Jr., DFC of Temecula, California is an officer of the United States Marine Corps.

Extended support ended on April 8, 2014, over 12 years since the release of XP; normally Microsoft products have a support life cycle of only 10 years. Beyond the final security updates released on April 8, no more security patches or support information are provided for XP free-of-charge; \"critical patches\" will still be created, and made available only to customers subscribing to a paid \"Custom Support\" plan. As it is a Windows component, all versions of Internet Explorer for Windows XP also became unsupported.\nIn January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million automated teller machines in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced IBM's OS/2 as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven and ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15. Plans were being made by several ATM vendors and their customers to migrate to Windows 7-based systems over the course of 2014, while vendors have also considered the possibility of using Linux-based platforms in the future to give them more flexibility for support lifecycles, and the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) has since endorsed Windows 10 as a further replacement. However, ATMs typically run the embedded variant of Windows XP, which was supported through January 2016. As of May 2017, around 60% of the 220,000 ATMs in India still run Windows XP.\nFurthermore, at least 49% of all computers in China still ran XP at the beginning of 2014. These holdouts were influenced by several factors; prices of genuine copies of Windows in the country are high, while Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government, and the Chinese government would ban the purchase of Windows 8 products for government use in May 2014 in protest of Microsoft's inability to provide \"guaranteed\" support. The government also had concerns that the impending end of support could affect their anti-piracy initiatives with Microsoft, as users would simply pirate newer versions rather than purchasing them legally. As such, government officials formally requested that Microsoft extend the support period for XP for these reasons. While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo, Kingsoft and Tencent, will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP. Several governments, in particular those of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate \"Custom Support\" plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government's deal lasted for a year, and also covered support for Office 2003 (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost \u00a35.5 million.\nOn March 8, 2014, Microsoft deployed an update for XP that, on the 8th of each month, displays a pop-up notification to remind users about the end of support; however, these notifications may be disabled by the user. Microsoft also partnered with Laplink to provide a special \"express\" version of its PCmover software to help users migrate files and settings from XP to a computer with a newer version of Windows.\nDespite the approaching end of support, there were still notable holdouts that had not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of Windows Vista, sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined because of the Great Recession and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (especially those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows).

In October he visited Scotland to suppress the dissenters and obtain money for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The intrigues organised by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, against his power in his absence, and the attacks made upon him in the House of Commons in January 1674 and April 1675, were alike rendered futile by the steady support of Charles and James.\nOn 25 June 1674 he was created Earl of Guilford and Baron Petersham in the Peerage of England. His ferocious measures having failed to suppress the conventicles in Scotland, he summoned to his aid in 1677 a band of Highlanders, who were sent into the western country. In consequence, a large party of Scottish nobles went to London, made common cause with the English Country Faction, and compelled Charles to order the disbandment of the marauders. In May 1678 another demand made in the Commons for Lauderdale's removal was defeated due to court influence, by a margin of only a single vote.\nHe maintained his triumphs almost to the end. In Scotland, which he visited immediately after this victory in the Parliament of England, he overbore all opposition to the king's demands for money. Another address for his removal from the Commons in England was suppressed by the dissolution of parliament on 26 May 1679, and a renewed attack upon him, by the Scottish party and Shaftesbury's faction combined, also failed.

Also its small cockpit fits only a certain demographic percentage of soaring pilots. The company developed the 205 with the design goals of a simple, rugged aircraft that would withstand club and fixed-base operator rental use. The resulting aircraft has a high-wing and a T-tail to provide more obstacle clearance as well as a larger cockpit. To eliminate gear-up landings the monowheel landing gear is non-retractable, although at least one Club Libelle exists (D-2468) which is equipped with retractable landing gear.\nThe aircraft is constructed from fibreglass. New wings were designed for the 205 that use a double-taper planform and incorporate combination spoilers and flaps that occupy two thirds of the wing's trailing edge.

In the 6th century BC, it became part of Satrapy of Armenia. From 189 BC, it became one of Greater Armenia's provinces. Then it became part of Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. After the division of 387, it was included into Persian Armenia. In the 8th century, it fell under Arab control. Many rebellions took place in Vaspurakan. In 885, within the territory of Kingdom of Armenia, it became free.\nDuring most of its history, it was ruled by the Ardzruni dynasty, which first managed to create a principality in the area. At its greatest extent Vaspurakan comprised the lands between Lake Van and Lake Urmia (also known as Kaputan) in 908. In 908 Gagik I of Vaspurakan was recognized King of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph in competition to the Bagratids, but soon he was reconciled with Ashot II, who recognized him as the King of Vaspurakan.

With the exception of the short reign of Beornrad, who succeeded \u00c6thelbald for less than a year, Mercia was ruled for eighty years by two of the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kings, \u00c6thelbald and Offa.  These long reigns were unusual at this early date; during the same period eleven kings reigned in Northumbria, many of whom died violent deaths.\nBy 731, \u00c6thelbald had all the English south of the Humber under his overlordship.  There is little direct evidence of the relationship between \u00c6thelbald and the kings who were dependent on him.  Generally, a king subject to an overlord such as \u00c6thelbald would still be regarded as a king, but would have his independence curtailed in some respects. Charters are an important source of evidence for this relationship; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land.  A charter granting land in the territory of one of the subject kings might record the names of the king as well as the overlord on the witness list appended to the grant; such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example. The titles given to the kings on these charters could also be revealing: a king might be described as a \"subregulus\", or underking.\nEnough information survives to suggest the progress of \u00c6thelbald's influence over two of the southern kingdoms, Wessex and Kent. At the start of \u00c6thelbald's reign, both Kent and Wessex were ruled by strong kings; Wihtred and Ine, respectively. Wihtred of Kent died in 725, and Ine of Wessex, one of the most formidable rulers of his day, abdicated in 726 to go on a pilgrimage to Rome. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ine's successor, Aethelheard, fought that year with an ealdorman named Oswald, whom the Chronicle provides with a genealogy showing descent from Ceawlin, an early king of Wessex. Aethelheard ultimately succeeded in this struggle for the throne, and there are subsequent indications that he ruled subject to Mercian authority. Hence it may be that \u00c6thelbald helped establish both Aethelheard and his brother, Cuthred, who succeeded Aethelheard in 739.  There is also evidence of South Saxon territory breaking away from West Saxon dominance in the early 720s, and this may indicate \u00c6thelbald's increasing influence in the area, though it could have been Kentish, rather than Mercian, influence that was weakening West Saxon control.\nAs for Kent, there is evidence from Kentish charters that shows that \u00c6thelbald was a patron of Kentish churches.  There is no charter evidence showing \u00c6thelbald's consent to Kentish land grants, and charters of Aethelberht and Eadberht, both kings of Kent, survive in which they grant land without \u00c6thelbald's consent. It may be that charters showing \u00c6thelbald's overlordship simply do not survive, but the result is that there is no direct evidence of the extent of \u00c6thelbald's influence in Kent.\nLess is known about events in Essex, but it was at about this time that London became attached to the kingdom of Mercia rather than that of Essex. Three of \u00c6thelbald's predecessors\u2014\u00c6thelred, Coenred, and Ceolred\u2014had each confirmed an East Saxon charter granting Twickenham to Waldhere, the bishop of London. From Kentish charters it is known that \u00c6thelbald was in control of London, and from \u00c6thelbald's time on, the transition to Mercian control appears to be complete; an early charter of Offa's, granting land near Harrow, does not even include the king of Essex on the witness list.  For the South Saxons, there is very little charter evidence, but as with Kent, what there is does not show any requirement for \u00c6thelbald's consent to land grants.   The lack of evidence should not obscure the fact that Bede, who was after all a contemporary chronicler, summarized the situation of England in 731 by listing the bishops in office in southern England, and adding that \"all these provinces, together with the others south of the river Humber and their kings, ", "The BMW K1200GT is a sport-touring motorcycle made by BMW.

She became a fashion icon during the silent film era, beginning with her success in the film The Toll of the Sea (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film Daughter of Shanghai (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film Piccadilly (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an American. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, B movies, and anti-Japanese propaganda films such as Bombs Over Burma (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the Japanese aggression in China. She was set to make her comeback with the film Flower Drum Song (1961) but was unable due to failing health. Despite a prolific career Wong's only film to have ever been a truly big success was Shanghai Express (1932). On February 8, 1960, Wong became the first Asian American actress to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nSessue Hayakawa was the first and one of the few Asian American/Asian actors to find stardom in the United States and Europe and was also the first leading Asian male actor in the United States. He became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to Rudolph Valentino. His fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. His fame began during the silent film era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer Thomas Ince saw his theatre play The Typhoon and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by Famous Players-Lasky now Paramount Pictures. His second film with the production company, The Cheat (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of romance films, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians. He personally chose American actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in his films such as The City of Dim Faces and His Birthright. Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film Bonds of Honor (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, The Dragon Painter. After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films The Great Prince Chan and the play Samurai which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time King George V and Queen Mary and a stage play version of The Three Musketeers. His fame in France came from France's fascination with anything Asian. In the 1930s with the rise of Talkies and growing Anti-Japanese sentiment due to World War II.

The layout of the parallel runways (1L/1R and 28R/28L) was established in the 1950s, and have a separation (centerline to centerline) of only 750 feet (230\u00a0m).\nDuring normal operations (approximately 81% of the time), domestic departures use Runways 1L and 1R for departure while overseas international departures and all arrivals use Runways 28L and 28R, taking advantage of the prevailing west-northwesterly wind coming through the San Bruno Gap. During periods of heavy winds or if operations at Oakland International Airport conflict with SFO departures (approximately 15% of the time), Runways 1L and 1R cannot be used, and so all departures and all arrivals use Runways 28L and 28R. These configurations are known collectively as the West Plan, and accommodate arrivals at a rate of up to 60 aircraft per hour. Under visual flight rules, aircraft may safely land side-by-side essentially simultaneously on 28L and 28R while maintaining visual separation.\nWhen the visual approach is compromised, the West Plan is maintained with a modification to allow aircraft landing on 28L to use Instrument Landing System (ILS) while the aircraft landing on 28R takes an offset course, monitored via high scan rate ground radar, to maintain a lateral spacing greater than 750\u00a0ft until the aircraft can maintain visual separation. Visual separation typically occurs once the aircraft has descended below the cloud deck at an altitude of 2,100 feet (640 m). This is known as the Precision Runway Monitor/Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approach and reduces the capacity to 36 arriving aircraft per hour. In poor visibility conditions, FAA instrument approach rules require aircraft to maintain lateral separation of 4,300 feet (1,300 m), meaning only one runway may be used, reducing the capacity of SFO to 25-30 arriving aircraft per hour.\nDuring rainstorms (approximately 4% of the time), the prevailing winds shift to a south-southeasterly direction, and departing aircraft use Runways 10L and 10R and arriving aircraft use Runways 19L and 19R. This configuration is known as the Southeast Plan.\nOn rare occasions (less than one day per year, on average), wind conditions dictate other runway configurations, including departures and landings on Runways 10L and 10R, departures and landings on Runways 1L and 1R, and departures on Runways 19L and 19R and landings on Runways 28L and 28R.", "An informal early 2012 study by the local newspaper La Perla del Sur concluded that riders were satisfied with the SITRAS mass transit service.

The cantons of Lucerne and Aargau lie to its west. To the north, the canton is bounded by the canton of Z\u00fcrich, whereas to the east and south lies the canton of Schwyz.\nMost of the land is considered productive. The Lake of Zug (German: Zugersee) and Lake \u00c4geri (German: \u00c4gerisee) make up a considerable part of the canton's area. Lake \u00c4geri is wholly within the canton, whereas the Zugersee is shared with the cantons of Lucerne and Schwyz.\nThe canton is located on a hilly plateau. The H\u00f6hronen (near H\u00f6hboden) is the highest elevation (1,229 m) in the east of the canton. The Zugerberg (1,039 m) in the south is another notable elevation. It connects in the south with the Rossberg massif which rises to the Wildspitz (1,583 m) east of the Zugersee. This massif separates the Zugersee from the basin and \u00c4gerisee. It also separates the hilly district of Menzingen from the Zugersee.\nThe river Lorze is the principal drainage in the canton. It originates in \u00c4gerisee, from where it flows northward through moraine deposits in a deep gorge with fine stalactite caverns. The river eventually enters the Zugersee, very near to where the Reuss originates. The Reuss forms the boundary of the canton in the north west.\nCanton Zug's borders were mainly established by nature itself: the rivers Sihl and Biber, and the H\u00f6hronen ridge in the east; the Rossberg mountain in the south, and the Rooterberg mountain, and the Reuss in the west. Only the 87.5\u00a0km-long border between the cantons of Z\u00fcrich and Zug is not naturally defined. With its 1580 m peak, the Wildspitz is the highest point in the canton.

It was built in 1882, and served as a charitable dispensary for Karachi's citizens. It was named after Karachi-based Parsi philanthropist Seth Edulji Dinshaw, who donated 5,500 rupees towards construction - half of the building's cost. Dinshaw had risen from poverty and became the largest landowner in Karachi at the time. It was designed James Strachan, and was Karachi's first Italianate building.", "Beginning in 1881, the Boston & Albany began a massive improvement program that included the building of over 30 new stations along its main line as well as the Highland Branch, which it bought in 1883. Famed architect H. H. Richardson was hired to design nine of these stations, including South Framingham which was commissioned in October 1883. The $62,718 station, built in 1884\u201385 by the Norcross Brothers company, was the largest and costliest of the nine. The station is a prime example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, built of rough-hewn granite with contrasting details. The dominant roofline, dormers, arched bow window, and wooden interior are typical of the style. Like many of Richardson's designs, the station was well-praised; Henry-Russell Hitchcock called it a \"better and somewhat more personal work\" in The Architecture of H. H. Richardson and His Time. A small square baggage room was built in the same style just east of the station, near the Concord Street (Route 126) grade crossing.\nThe station's importance remained through the first half of the 20th century. After the Boston & Albany was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900, third and fourth tracks were extended in 1907 to South Framingham from Lake Crossing station in Wellesley. In 1911, the NYC considered laying third rail on the main line as far as South Framingham, as well as on the Highland Branch, to allow more frequent electric service on the lines. This would have been the only electrified commuter service directly into Boston, as neither the later-electrified Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad nor experimental electric service on the South Shore Railroad went directly to downtown. However, the plan was abandoned because the infrastructure cost would have exceeded the annual savings on fuel. (In 1959, the Highland Branch received catenary wire and was turned into the Green Line D branch).\nDue in no small part to the presence of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham.

In the 19th century, the Champagne cup was a popular cocktail, consisting of champagne, lemon juice, sugar, and ice. Gin was sometimes added, yielding a drink much like the French 75.\nThe drink was first recorded as the 75 in Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails, 1922 edition, by Harry MacElhone, and in the same year in Robert Vermeire's Cocktails: How to Mix Them, which credits the drink to MacElhone. However, the recipes differed from the current form \u2013 MacElhone's version consisted of Calvados, gin, grenadine, and absinthe, while Vermeire added lemon juice.\nThe recipe took its now-classic form and \"French 75\" name in Here\u2019s How, by Judge Jr. (1927), consisting of gin, sugar, lemon juice, and champagne. This recipe was republished with the name French 75 in The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), which helped popularize the drink. Some later cocktail books use Cognac instead of gin, such as The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks by David A. Embury.\nThe French 75 was popularized in America at the Stork Club in New York. It appears in the movie Casablanca (1942) and is referenced twice in the John Wayne films A Man Betrayed (1941) and Jet Pilot (1957).  In 2016, it appears in the ITV series, Mr. Selfridge, which is set in London in the 1910s and 1920s.\nA fanciful alternative story of the invention of the French 75 was related by Jean Shepherd on November 17, 1969, wherein he credits Gervais Raoul Lufbery as the inventor. The mixture, as related by Shepherd, is Champagne and Cognac on ice with perhaps a twist of lemon.

However engine power had reduced as a result of either downsizing to six-cylinder engines or detuning the V8 engines in order to comply with increasingly strict vehicle emissions standards. Along with the reduced straight-line performance, the cars also had poor fuel economy and were battling against the industry trend towards smaller cars.\nThe 1980 Chrysler Imperial (sixth generation) marked a key milestone in the decline of the personal luxury car. The 318\u00a0cu\u00a0in (5.2\u00a0L) V8 engine produced only 140\u00a0hp (104\u00a0kW), Reaction in the motoring press was especially vicious, with Car and Driver referring to this Imperial as an outmoded all frosting automobile. Sales were poor. The Imperial was built on the Chrysler Cordoba (second generation) chassis, a car with declining sales, that was discontinued in 1983. \nThe 1980 Ford Thunderbird (eighth generation) and Mercury Cougar (fifth generation) were downsized to a mid-size car and described as \"stodgy-looking\". Sales were drastically reduced, resulting in extensive revisions for the 1983 model year. While remaining a personal luxury coupe, the redesign of the Thunderbird and Cougar introduced highly aerodynamic body design to Ford vehicles in North America and significantly increased sales.\nIn 1981, sales of the Cadillac Eldorado (eighth generation) were down 40% and Continental Mark VI were down 50%.  \nFor the 1984 model year, Continental Mark VII was downsized to a mid-size car, based on a platform shared with the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.\nFor 1986, General Motors drastically downsized the Cadillac Eldorado (ninth generation), Buick Riviera (seventh generation) and Oldsmobile Toronado (fourth generation) by 13\u201316\u00a0in (330\u2013406\u00a0mm). With a sales drop of 60%, seldom has any model experienced such a dramatic fall in sales. The Riviera and Toronado used Buick's 232\u00a0cu\u00a0in (3.8\u00a0L) V6 engine, while Cadillac continued to use their 250\u00a0cu\u00a0in (4.1\u00a0L) V8 engine. The Eldorado's convertible body style was discontinued and replaced with the Cadillac Allant\u00e9 luxury roadster. The base price of the 1986 Eldorado increased by approximately 16% to $24,251 and production was reduced to about a quarter of what it had been just two years earlier. Similarly, the 1986 Riviera's base price increased substantially to $19,831, and sales plummeted to 22,138 for 1986, only 15,223 for 1987, and 8,625 for 1988 (although the 1988 introduction of the Buick Reatta coupe may have cannibalized some Riviera sales that year).\nThe final year of production for the  rear-wheel-drive Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (fourth generation) was 1988, during which 27,678 were built. \nFor 1988, GM moved the Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix to versions based on GMs front-wheel-drive W-body platform. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo was discontinued after a short 1988 model year run (replaced by the 1990 Chevrolet Lumina mid-size coupe). With the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Celebrity and Pontiac 6000, the Regal, Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix moved from the personal luxury segment to the conventional mid-size segment, and were also offered in the 4-door body style.", "Lakki Marwat District (Pashto: \u0644\u06a9\u06cd \u0645\u0631\u0648\u062a \u0648\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0627\u0644\u06cd\u200e, Urdu: \u0636\u0650\u0644\u0639 \u0644\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u0631\u0648\u062a\u200e) is a district in Bannu Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan.

Among them are a smaller portrait taken in 1888, which she used as a basis for a larger work in 1889.  The larger version of the portrait was reported to be in the Museo Historico Nacional, and another version in the provincial legislature of Buenos Aires, as of the 50th anniversary of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death in 1938. On September 4, 1938, a full-page color reproduction was published in La Prensa (Buenos Aires). The same issue of La Prensa included a photograph of Eugenia and her sister Elena.\nAnother family portrait subject was Sarmiento's adopted son Dominguito Fidel Sarmiento, who died in battle against Paraguay. In addition, she painted classical portraits of notable figures of the time such as Dalmacio V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Francisco Muniz and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Estrada. As of 1885, she was contracted by the government of the province of San Juan to paint portraits of Salvador Mar\u00eda del Carril, Antonino Aberastain, and Francisco Narciso de Laprida.

The potentiometer is a simple device used to measure the electrical potentials (or compare the e.m.f of a cell). One form of potentiometer is a uniform high-resistance wire attached to an insulating support, marked with a linear measuring scale. In use, an adjustable regulated voltage source E, of greater magnitude than the potential to be measured, is connected across the wire so as to pass a steady current through it.  \n\nBetween the end of the wire and any point along it will be a potential proportional to the length of wire to that point. By comparing the potential at points along the wire with an unknown potential, the magnitude of the unknown potential can be determined.  The instrument used for comparison  must be sensitive, but need not be particularly well-calibrated or accurate so long as its deflection from zero position can be easily detected.", "Kind was born and raised in La Crosse, the third of five children born to Greta and Elroy Kind.

In the two years that followed, the Albanian-Tetan coalition won over the Ottomans. On May 14, 1450, the first siege of Kruja began, which the Ottomans had to end the following year without success. In 1451 Skanderbeg formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Naples for the time being, however, the Albanians received no help from there. In 1452 the Ottomans were defeated at Mokrra and Me\u00e7adi. After the fall of Constantinople  Albanians received financial aid from Naples and Venice as well as from the Pope. Until 1462, Skanderbeg's troops were able to defeat the Ottomans every year without significantly weakening their superiority. Every year the sultan was able to send a new army without difficulty. Only in 1460 and 1463 did ceasefires interrupt the fighting. In 1462 Skanderbeg succeeded in taking the important city of Ohrid.\nIn 1466 the second siege of Kruje Castle was knocked down.

Currently located next to the Government Palace and the Macroplaza, it originally covered a larger space from the Santa Catarina River to 5 de Mayo Street, south to north, and from Mina Street to Roble Street (nowadays Avenida Benito Ju\u00e1rez), east to west.

However, the buildings preserved today date mostly from the eighteenth century onwards. It used to be the commercial and cultural center of the city during the existence of the Viceroyalty of New Spain until recently the first half of the 20th century, when other parts of the city began to grow more to the detriment of the center. During the last decades of the 20th century there was a modern lifestyle in the Barrio Antiguo, characterized by the construction of hotels, museums, bars, discos and restaurants of international cuisine. Thus until depopulation and partial abandonment tended to decline from the 1990s to recent times, as currently there are projects under way for its restoration. Many houses of what used to be the Barrio Antiguo were demolished to give way to the construction of the Macroplaza (lit. big square) at the end of the past century. During the last decade of the twentieth century and recent years, Barrio Antiguo was well known as the center of the nightlife of Monterrey due to measures taken by the State in a failed attempt to create reforms that pushed the re-activation of the urban center.   \nSince 2006, due to the insecurity that was rampant in the city of Monterrey, nightlife in the Barrio Antiguo almost ended, but since recent times due to the relative decline in violence many of the bars have managed to survive. From the year 2013 the government changed the way in which the Old Quarter was considered.

The latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other European powers, Aboriginal peoples, and later American forces during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812, as well as in the Fenian raids, Red River Rebellion, and North-West Rebellion. Consequently, the lineages of some Canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century, when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of British North America against invasion by the United States.\nThe responsibility for military command remained with the British Crown-in-Council, with a commander-in-chief for North America stationed at Halifax until the final withdrawal of British Army and Royal Navy units from that city in 1906. Thereafter, the Royal Canadian Navy was formed, and, with the advent of military aviation, the Royal Canadian Air Force. These forces were organised under the Department of Militia and Defence, and split into the Permanent and Non-Permanent Active Militias\u2014frequently shortened to simply The Militia. By 1923, the department was merged into the Department of National Defence.\nThe first significant overseas deployment of Canadian military forces occurred during the Second Boer War, when several units were raised to serve under British command. Similarly, when the United Kingdom entered into conflict with Germany in the First World War, Canadian troops were called to participate in European theatres. Battles which are particularly notable to the Canadian military include the Second Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Second Battle of Passchendaele, as well as a series of attacks undertaken by the Canadian Corps during the Hundred Days Offensive.\nDuring this period, a distinctly Canadian army and navy was established, followed by an air force, that, because of the constitutional arrangements at the time, remained effectively under the control of the British government until Canada gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931, in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the Canadian Corps in the First World War. In November 1940, the Canadian militia was formally renamed the Canadian Army. However, in the 1950s, Reserve Army forces were once again referred to as \"Militia\" in official documentation, and although rare, is still used to refer to part-time members.\nCanadian Forces entered the Second World War in September 1939, after the Canadian Crown-in-Council declared war on Nazi Germany. Battles and campaigns during the Second World War that were particularly notable to the Canadian military include the Battle of the Atlantic, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of Hong Kong, the Dieppe Raid, the invasion of Sicily and Italy, Operation Overlord, the Siegfried Line Campaign, Operation Veritable, as well as the strategic bombing of German cities.\nAt the end of the Second World War, Canada possessed the fourth-largest air force and fifth-largest naval surface fleet in the world, as well as the largest volunteer army ever fielded. Conscription for overseas service was introduced only near the end of the war, and only 2,400 conscripts actually made it into battle. Originally, Canada was thought to have had the third-largest navy in the world, but with the fall of the Soviet Union, new data based on Japanese and Soviet sources found that to be incorrect.\nSince 1947, Canadian military units have participated in more than 200 operations worldwide, and completed 72 international operations. Canadian soldiers, sailors, and aviators came to be considered world-class professionals through conspicuous service during these conflicts and the country's integral participation in NATO during the Korean War, First Gulf War, Kosovo War, and in United Nations Peacekeeping operations, such as the Suez Crisis, Golan Heights, Cyprus, Croatia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Libya.

Transplant programs for heart, lung, liver, kidney, and bone marrow are offered. Notably, St. Louis Children's is home to the world's largest pediatric lung transplant program; approximately 400 lung and lung-heart transplants have been performed.\nThe hospital's Center for Cerebral Palsy Spasticity performs more selective dorsal rhizotomy surgeries than any facility in the United States.

The study found that the United States failed to achieve better outcomes than other countries, and is last or near last in terms of access, efficiency and equity. Study date came from international surveys of patients and primary care physicians, as well as information on health care outcomes from The Commonwealth Fund, the World Health Organization, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\nAs of 2017, the U.S. stands 43rd in the world with a life expectancy of 80.00 years. The CIA World Factbook ranked the United States 170th worst (out of 225) \u2013 meaning 55th best \u2013 in the world for infant mortality rate (5.80/1,000 live births). Americans also undergo cancer screenings at significantly higher rates than people in other developed countries, and access MRI and CT scans at the highest rate of any OECD nation.\nA study found that between 1997 and 2003, preventable deaths declined more slowly in the United States than in 18 other industrialized nations. A 2008 study found that 101,000 people a year die in the U.S. that would not if the health care system were as effective as that of France, Japan, or Australia. A 2020 study by the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton argues that the United States \"spends huge sums of money for some of the worst health outcomes in the Western world.\"\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the U.S. ranked poorly in terms of years of potential life lost (YPLL), a statistical measure of years of life lost under the age of 70 that were amenable to being saved by health care. Among OECD nations for which data are available, the United States ranked third last for the health care of women (after Mexico and Hungary) and fifth last for men (Slovakia and Poland also ranked worse).\nRecent studies find growing gaps in life expectancy based on income and geography. In 2008, a government-sponsored study found that life expectancy declined from 1983 to 1999 for women in 180 counties, and for men in 11 counties, with most of the life expectancy declines occurring in the Deep South, Appalachia, along the Mississippi River, in the Southern Plains and in Texas. The difference is as high as three years for men, six years for women. The gap is growing between rich and poor and by educational level, but narrowing between men and women and by race. Another study found that the mortality gap between the well-educated and the poorly educated widened significantly between 1993 and 2001 for adults ages 25 through 64; the authors speculated that risk factors such as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure may lie behind these disparities. In 2011 the U.S. National Research Council forecasted that deaths attributed to smoking, on the decline in the US, will drop dramatically, improving life expectancy; it also suggested that one-fifth to one-third of the life expectancy difference can be attributed to obesity which is the worst in the world and has been increasing. In an analysis of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer diagnosed during 1990\u20131994 in 31 countries, the U.S. had the highest five-year relative survival rate for breast cancer and prostate cancer, although survival was systematically and substantially lower in black U.S. men and women.\nThe debate about U.S. health care concerns questions of access, efficiency, and quality purchased by the high sums spent. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000 ranked the U.S. health care system first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the study).

The Broad Progressive Front was a socialist coalition that placed second in the 2011 Argentine general election, with the candidate Hermes Binner. UNEN was another coalition created in the 2013 Argentine legislative election, composed by the Radical Civic Union, Proyecto Sur, and the Civic Coalition ARI. With the candidates Pino Solanas and Elisa Carri\u00f3 running for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, respectively, UNEN placed second in the city of Buenos Aires, forcing Daniel Filmus (the candidate of the national government) into third place, thus ousting him from Senate.\nThe Broad Front UNEN coalition had its inauguration at the Argentine Broadway Theatre. Radical politician Luis Brandoni announced the content of the constitution document, which was then signed by the leaders of the parties.\nThe coalition includes most Argentine parties that are not Peronist. The likely Peronist candidates for the 2015 presidential election are Daniel Scioli, governor of the Buenos Aires province; Sergio Massa, elected deputy in 2013; and other candidates sponsored by the national government such as Sergio Urribarri and Florencio Randazzo.\nThere was some controversy about the inclusion of the Republican Proposal, led by Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri, in the coalition. Macri's support would be needed to counter the powerful Peronist parties, but he is a conservative and most parties in the coalition are left-wing or centre-left. As of April 2014, Solanas, Margarita Stolbizer, and Ricardo Alfons\u00edn rejected to join forces with Macri, whereas Carri\u00f3 and other radicals did not reject the idea. Macri ruled out an electoral alliance, but proposed instead to find consensus for national policies after the elections.\nThe inauguration of the provincial wing of UNEN for the Buenos Aires Province, the largest province of Argentina, is scheduled for May 22, one month after the general national inauguration. It will take place at the National University of Avellaneda.

There is an amazingly wide range of stones used for the sculpture of the king, not attested for any king before. Furthermore, the king introduced several new types of sculptures, many of these types inspired by older prototypes, dating back to the early Dynastic Period. There are two facial types that can be assigned to Amenemhat III. \nrealistic style: The face of the king shows its bone structure, furrows are clearly marked in the face. The face features are evidently inspired by those of the sculpture of Senusret III\nidealized style: The king is shown as young man, with a triangular face.", "The following is a list of some of the disagreements between experimental observations and the \"soliton model\":\nAntidromic invasion of soma from axon\nAn action potential initiated anywhere on an axon will travel in an antidromic (backward) direction to the neuron soma (cell body) without loss of amplitude and produce a full-amplitude action potential in the soma. As the membrane area of the soma is orders of magnitude larger than the area of the axon, conservation of energy requires that an adiabatic mechanical wave decrease in amplitude. Since the absence of heat production is one of the claimed justifications of the 'soliton model', this is particularly difficult to explain within that model.\nPersistence of action potential over wide temperature range\nAn important assumption of the soliton model is the presence of a phase transition near the ambient temperature of the axon (\"Formalism\", above). Then, rapid change of temperature away from the phase transition temperature would necessarily cause large changes in the action potential. Below the phase transition temperature, the soliton wave would not be possible. Yet, action potentials are present at 0\u00a0\u00b0C. The time course is slowed in a manner predicted by the measured opening and closing kinetics of the Hodgkin-Huxley ion channels.\nCollisions\nNerve impulses traveling in opposite directions annihilate each other on collision. On the other hand, mechanical waves do not annihilate but pass through each other. Soliton model proponents have attempted to show that action potentials can pass through a collision; however, collision annihilation of orthodromic and antidromic action potentials is a routinely observed phenomenon in neuroscience laboratories and are the basis of a standard technique for identification of neurons. Solitons pass each other on collision (Figure--\"Collision of Solitons\"), solitary waves in general can pass, annihilate or bounce of each other and solitons are only a special case of such solitary waves.\nIonic currents under voltage clamp\nThe voltage clamp, used by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) (Hodgkin-Huxley Model) to experimentally dissect the action potential in the squid giant axon, uses electronic feedback to measure the current necessary to hold membrane voltage constant at a commanded value. A silver wire, inserted into the interior of the axon, forces a constant membrane voltage along the length of the axon. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility of a traveling 'soliton'. Any thermodynamic changes are very different from those resulting from an action potential. Yet, the measured currents accurately reproduce the action potential.\nSingle channel currents\nThe patch clamp technique isolates a microscopic patch of membrane on the tip of a glass pipette. It is then possible to record currents from single ionic channels. There is no possibility of propagating solitons or thermodynamic changes. Yet, the properties of these channels (temporal response to voltage jumps, ionic selectivity) accurately predict the properties of the macroscopic currents measured under conventional voltage clamp.\nSelective ionic conductivity\nThe current underlying the action potential depolarization is selective for sodium. Repolarization depends on a selective potassium current. These currents have very specific responses to voltage changes which quantitatively explain the action potential. Substitution of non-permeable ions for sodium abolishes the action potential. The 'soliton model' cannot explain either the ionic selectivity or the responses to voltage changes.\nPharmacology\nThe drug tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks action potentials at extremely low concentrations. The site of action of TTX on the sodium channel has been identified. Dendrotoxins block the potassium channels. These drugs produce quantitatively predictable changes in the action potential. The 'soliton model' provides no explanation for these pharmacological effects.", "A student is primarily a person enrolled in a school or other educational institution and who is under learning with goals of acquiring  knowledge, developing professions and achieving easy employment at a particular field. In the broader sense, a student is anyone who applies themselves to the intensive intellectual engagement with some matter necessary to master it as part of some practical affair in which such mastery is basic or decisive.\nIn the United Kingdom and most commonwealth countries, the term \"student\" denotes those enrolled in secondary schools and higher (e.g., college or university); those enrolled in primary/elementary schools are called \"pupils\".", "First shown as a technical and thematic demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division.\nNintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release Ocarina of Time for the 64DD, a disk drive peripheral for the system, which was still in development. Nintendo eventually migrated the development of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay. They planned to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk.\nInitially planned as a 16-megabyte game, it was later increased to 32 megabytes, making it the largest game Nintendo had created at the time. Early in development, the team had concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge; in the worst-case scenario, Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64, with Link restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, was used as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.\nWhile Shigeru Miyamoto had been the principal director of Super Mario 64, he was now in charge of several directors as a producer and supervisor of Ocarina of Time. Different parts were handled by different directors, a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. Four or five initial teams grew over time, each working on different basic experiments, including scenario and planning, Link's actions, transforming classic 2D items into improved 3D form, camera experiments, motion capture, sound, special effects, and the flow of time.\nAlthough the development team was new to 3D games, assistant director Makoto Miyanaga recalled a \"passion for creating something new and unprecedented\". Miyamoto intended the game, a \"medieval tale of sword and sorcery\", to be in the chanbara genre of Japanese sword fighting. The development involved more than 120 people, including stunt performers used to capture the effects of sword fighting and Link's movement. Miyamoto initially intended Ocarina of Time to be played in a first-person perspective to enable players to take in the vast terrain of Hyrule Field better and let the team focus more on developing enemies and environments. The concept was abandoned once the idea of a child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Originally Z-targeting involved a generic marker, however Koizumi changed the design to that of a fairy to make it less \"robotic\". The fairy gained the name of the \"Fairy Navigation System\" amongst staff, and ultimately, this turned into the nickname \"Navi\", which in turn resulted in the \"birth\" of Navi's character. The \"birth\" of Navi was a pivotal point in the story's development.\nSome of Miyamoto's ideas were instead used in Super Mario 64, since it was to be released first. Other ideas were not used due to time constraints. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that Miyamoto considers the final products different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game AI. Miyamoto said the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.\nMiyamoto wanted to make a game that was cinematic, yet distinguished from films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, said that his priority was to have the player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are comple", "Whiteknights Park, or the Whiteknights Campus of the University of Reading, is the principal campus of that university.

The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\", as one historian has put it. Gibraltar's location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.\nGibraltar was first inhabited over 50,000 years ago by Neanderthals and may have been one of their last places of habitation before they died out around 24,000 years ago. Gibraltar's recorded history began around 950 BC with the Phoenicians, who lived nearby. The Carthaginians and Romans later worshipped Hercules in shrines said to have been built on the Rock of Gibraltar, which they called Mons Calpe, the \"Hollow Mountain\", and which they regarded as one of the twin Pillars of Hercules.\nGibraltar became part of the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania following the collapse of the Roman Empire and came under Muslim Moorish rule in 711 AD. It was permanently settled for the first time by the Moors and was renamed Jebel Tariq \u2013 the Mount of Tariq, later corrupted into Gibraltar. The Christian Crown of Castile annexed it in 1309, lost it again to the Moors in 1333 and finally regained it in 1462. Gibraltar became part of the unified Kingdom of Spain and remained under Spanish rule until 1704. It was captured during the War of the Spanish Succession by an Anglo-Dutch fleet in the name of Charles VI of Austria, the Habsburg contender to the Spanish throne. At the war's end, Spain ceded the territory to Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713.\nSpain tried to regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had declared a Crown colony, through military, diplomatic and economic pressure. Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By the end of the last siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major base in the Peninsular War. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming a key British possession in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to India via the Suez Canal. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.\nBritish control of Gibraltar enabled the Allies to control the entrance to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed its border with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to self-determination. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.\nSince 1985, Gibraltar has undergone major changes as a result of reductions in Britain's overseas defence commitments. Most British forces have left the territory, which is no longer seen as a place of major military importance. Its economy is now based on tourism, financial services, shipping and Internet gambling. Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with its own parliament and government, though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy. Its economic success had made it one of the wealthiest areas of the European Union.", "The Caspian plover (Charadrius asiaticus) is a wader in the plover family of birds. The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in ravines and river valleys (kharadra, \"ravine\"). The specific asiaticus is  Latin and means \"Asian\", although in binomials it usually means the type locality was India.\nThis plover breeds in western and central Asia and migrates southward to eastern and southern Africa to escape the northern winter.", "The first dynamo based on Faraday's principles was built in 1832 by Hippolyte Pixii, a French instrument maker. It used a permanent magnet which was rotated by a crank. The spinning magnet was positioned so that its north and south poles passed by a piece of iron wrapped with insulated wire.\nPixii found that the spinning magnet produced a pulse of current in the wire each time a pole passed the coil. However, the north and south poles of the magnet induced currents in opposite directions. To convert the alternating current to DC, Pixii invented a commutator, a split metal cylinder on the shaft, with two springy metal contacts that pressed against it.\nThis early design had a problem: the electric current it produced consisted of a series of \"spikes\" or pulses of current separated by none at all, resulting in a low average power output. As with electric motors of the period, the designers did not fully realize the seriously detrimental effects of large air gaps in the magnetic circuit.\nAntonio Pacinotti, an Italian physics professor, solved this problem around 1860 by replacing the spinning two-pole axial coil with a multi-pole toroidal one, which he created by wrapping an iron ring with a continuous winding, connected to the commutator at many equally spaced points around the ring; the commutator being divided into many segments. This meant that some part of the coil was continually passing by the magnets, smoothing out the current.\nThe Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.

It features a \"balanced\" operating system, similar to that used in the AEK-971. In this case, the designation AK does not indicate Avtomat Kalashnikova but Alexandrov/Kalashnikov. The revised designation indicates the incorporation of a new gas system, designed by Youriy Alexandrov, for Kalashnikov-pattern rifles.\nThese new rifles were derived from the AL-7 experimental rifle of the early 1970s. The AL-7 utilized an innovative balanced gas operating system known as the Balanced Automatics Recoil System (BARS) developed by Peter Andreevich Tkachev of TsNIITochMash that was first used earlier on the AO-38 assault rifle of 1965 that essentially eliminated felt recoil and muzzle rise. The system was modified by Alexandrov, then a junior engineer at Izhmash, and prototypes were produced under the designation AL-7. The AL-7 was considered too expensive for production at the time and the Soviet Army selected the AK-74 instead as the new service rifle. No further development occurred until the mid-1990s when Alexandrov, by then a senior engineer, was directed to update his design for production as a less expensive alternative to the AN-94. The new rifle differs only slightly from the original AL-7. The AK-107 receiver is not fluted and a three-round burst feature has been added. There is otherwise little difference between it and the AL-7 prototypes.", "The portrait was commissioned by the art-loving Tommaso as the right-hand wing of a triptych. She was placed opposite her husband, with a now lost central Madonna and Child. Their small size and intimacy suggests that the portraits were commissioned for private prayer; some art historians believe, given that Tommaso's cultural acumen and preoccupation with his social standing, they were partially accessible to the public. The triptych may have been intended for the Portinari Chapel, located behind the apse of the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio, Milan, and constructed between 1462 and 1468.\nMaria would have been around 14 years old at the time the portrait was commissioned, either the year of her marriage in 1470 or shortly after.

It describes a finding that in many (perhaps most) networks the mean path distances between vertices are surprisingly small. It has many implications in various areas of network studies. For instance, in social network, one can ruminate how fast a rumor (or a contagious disease) is spread in a community. From a mathematical point of view, since path lengths in networks are typically scale as log n (where n = number of network vertices), it is only logical it remains a small number even with large complex networks.\nAnother idea comes along with the small-world effect is called funneling. It was derived from a social network experiment conducted by the experimental psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. In that experiment he concluded, along with the small-world effect phenomenon, that in any given social network, there were always few that were especially well connected. These few individuals were therefore responsible for the connection between any members and the rest of the world.\nDegree, Hubs, and Paths\nDegree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. For example, on Figure 4, vertex 3 has a degree of five. Hubs are vertices in a network with a relatively higher degree. Vertex 3 again is a good example. In a social network, hubs can mean individuals with many acquaintances. In risk assessment, it can mean a hazardous event with multiple triggers (or the causal part of a bow-tie diagram). A path in a network is a route between a vertex and another across the network. From the same figure, an example of a path from vertex 1 to 6 can be 1\u21925\u21923\u21926.\nCentrality\nCentrality is a measure of how important (or central) certain vertices are in a network. It can be measured by counting the number of edges connected to it (i.e its degree). The vertices with the highest degree therefore have a high degree centrality.\nDegree centrality can have many implications. In a social network, a person with high degree centrality may have more influence over others, more access to information, or more opportunities than those with fewer connections. In a citation network, a paper with high degree centrality may suggest it is more influential and thus has a greater impact on its respective area of research.\nEigenvector centrality is an extension of the concept of degree centrality, based on the fact that in many networks not all vertices have the same weight or importance. A vertex's importance in its network increases if it has more connections to important vertices. Eigenvector centrality, therefore, can be view as a centrality scoring system for not just one but its neighboring vertices as well.\nComponents\nSubgroups, or subsets of vertices, in a disconnected network. Disconnected network means in such network, there is at least a pair of vertices that no path connecting between them at all. Vice verse is known as a connected network, where all vertices within are connected by at least one path. One can therefore say a connected network has only one component.\nDirected Networks \nNetworks of which each edge has a direction from one vertex to another. The edges are therefore known as directed edges. Example of such network include a link from the reference section on this page which will leads you to another, but not the other way around. In terms of food web, a prey eaten by a predator is another example.\nDirected networks can be cyclic or acyclic. A cyclic directed network is one with a closed loop of edges. An acyclic directed network does not contain such loop. Since a self-edge \u2013 an edge connecting a vertex to itself \u2013 is considered a cycle, it is therefore absent from any acyclic network.\nA Bayesian network is an example of an acyclic directed network.\nWeighted Network\nIn reality, not all edges shares the same importance or weight (connections in a social network and keystone species in a food web, for example). A weighted network adds such element to its connections. It is widely used in genomic and systems biologic applications.\nTrees", "Fultonham is a village in Muskingum County, Ohio, United States.

The new shipping company had no association with the British maritime classification society Lloyd's Register; in the mid-19th century, \"Lloyd\" was used as a term for a shipping company (an earlier user of the term in the same context was the Trieste-based \u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd).\nH. H. Meier became NDL's first Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and Cr\u00fcsemann became the first director of the company (German Aktiengesellschaft \u2013 AG). Cr\u00fcsemann was in charge of both cargo services and passenger transport, which, as a result of emigration, was growing significantly. The company was also active in other areas, including tugboats, bathing, insurance, and ship repair (the last of which it still provides). The first office of the shipping company was located at number 13 Martinistra\u00dfe in Bremen.\nThe company started with a route to England prior to starting a transatlantic service. In 1857, the first ship, the Adler (Eagle), began regular passenger service between the Weser region (where Bremen is located) and England. On 28 October 1857, it made its maiden voyage from Nordenham to London.\nJust one year later, regular, scheduled services were started between the new port in Bremerhaven and New York using two 2,674\u00a0GRT steamships, the Bremen and the New York. International economic crises made the start of the NDL extremely difficult, and the company took losses until 1859. However, during the succeeding years, passenger connections to Baltimore and New Orleans were added to the schedule, and the company first rented and then in 1869 bought facilities on the waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nIn 1867\u20131868, NDL began a partnership with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which initiated the Baltimore Line; until 1978, this had its own ships. In 1869, Cr\u00fcsemann died at only 43 years old. From 1877 to 1892, the Director of NDL was Johann Georg Lohmann. He established a new policy for the company, emphasizing fast liners. Eventually, however, H. H. Meier and Lohmann fell out over the direction of the company. In 1892, a 5,481\u00a0GRT twin-screw steamer, the company's first, was christened the H.H. Meier after the founder; this helped to heal the breach between them.", "This list ranks completed and topped-out buildings.

His early infantry were also equipped with protective helmets and greaves, as well as sarissa pikes, yet according to Sekunda they were eventually equipped with heavier armour such as cuirasses, since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts. As evidenced by the Alexander Sarcophagus, troops serving Alexander the Great were also armoured in the hoplite fashion. However, Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip V's reign periods (during which sufficient evidence exists). Instead, he claims that breastplates were only worn by military officers, while pikemen wore the kotthybos along with their helmets and greaves, wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields.\nThere is a considerable body of evidence to suggest that the different classes of Macedonian soldier trained to use a variety of arms and equipment. Certainly, cavalry, including Alexander himself, fought on foot during sieges and assaults on fortified settlements, phalangites are described using javelins and some infantrymen were trained to ride horses. The deployment of differing types of armour and weapons was dependent solely on the requirements of a particular tactical situation.", "Liscannor probably takes its name from an old fort that was located here. Lis meaning a \"fort\" and Cannor a corruption of the name \"Connor\".\nThe area around Liscannor was part of the Barony of Corcomroe, controlled by the O\u2019Connor family.\nAt least 30 ships of the Spanish Armada, sent to invade England in the summer of 1588, were lost along the coast of Ireland, mainly along the western seaboard. The oar-powered galleass Zu\u00f1iga was damaged, and anchored off-shore of Liscannor. The ship came under surveillance by the High Sheriff of Clare and by crown forces and had to withdraw to their ship. One captive was taken and sent for interrogation. The Zu\u00f1iga escaped the coast with favorable winds, and later reached Le Havre.\nThe village of Liscannor is of late 18th century origin. According to an 1814 survey there were nearly 200 houses in it at the time, and about ten of them had flag roofs. 40 houses were used by fishermen.", "The Victorian Football Association (VFA) was formed on 7 May 1877 at Oliver's Cafe in Melbourne, which was just seven days after the SAFA (later SANFL), which formed on 30 April 1877. The VFA took over and controlled the Victorian Junior Football Association (VJFA), although the VJFA had its own administration. It had an initial membership of 10 senior clubs and a number of junior clubs, seven of which are listed below: Junior clubs did not mean underage, a club was classed as junior on it ability and experience. In the 1880s there were up to 300 junior clubs in Victoria. Some of these clubs were only social clubs who played a couple of games a year, other played weekly and had the desire to become a senior club. Country clubs played when they could as they did not get the half holidays as they did in the city. It was not uncommon for junior clubs to emerge or re-form under a different name.\nIn the early days, any club was eligible to join the VFA upon payment of an annual subscription.  However, Senior clubs were mainly selected on merit but there were other criteria.  For example, Senior clubs were required to have a minimum membership of 80.\nDuring the first decades, the VFA was not responsible for the setting of fixtures, which continued to be the province of meetings between the secretaries of the various clubs. However, by the late 1880s, a rule had been introduced that made any club that didn't play at least 18 games in a season, ineligible for the Premiership. As an example, in 1889 bottom club Footscray had only played 16 games. Finally, in 1891, the association set up a sub-committee under North Melbourne's W. R. Mullins which took on the responsibility of setting fixtures.\nHowever, a lot of the other organisational work was now done by the VFA, from its inception, including the setting of rules and the naming of the premiers (or champion team). The number of players continued to vary according to the strength of the opposition, but if two equally ranked teams were pitted against each other, there were usually 20 players on each team.\nFrom 1878, points were listed but only goals counted towards the score and, therefore, there were a great number of drawn games. Even though behinds did not count towards a result, in 1893 the VFA awarded the Stars and Stripes Trophy to the team kicking the fewest behinds in ratio to the number of goals scored in premiership matches. This was done to encourage accurate kicking for goal. Melbourne won the trophy with a percentage of 78.6, barely ahead of Williamstown at 78.5. The unusual trophy name comes from the fact that the trophy was awarded by Messrs Jacobs, Hart & Co., manufacturers of Stars and Stripes cigarettes.\nBetween 1873 and 1893 no fewer than six teams went through a season undefeated:\nSouth Melbourne was undefeated in 1886 until playing the undefeated Geelong in a special game to determine the premiership (see below: \"The Game of the Century\").\nIn 1877, Carlton became the first Victorian football team to play in New South Wales. They played two games against Waratah, winning one under Victorian rules and losing a rugby game.\nIn 1886 there were as many as 18 VFA clubs. The VFA decided to reduce the numbers and in 1888 they merged the Williamstown Football Club with the South Williamstown Football Club, merged the St Kilda Football Club with the original Prahran Football Club, and removed the three Ballarat clubs; Ballarat, Ballarat Imperials and South Ballarat (these clubs then became the base of a local Ballarat League). In 1889, the Melbourne Football Club and the original University Football Club were also merged.\nBy 1896, there were 13 teams in the VFA Senior competition. The ladder in that year was:\nA play-off was held at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground to determine the premiership: Collingwood 6.9 d. South Melbourne 5.10.\nThe VFA did not have regular finals during this period and the above table represents the situation at the end of what is now called the home-and-away matches.\nIn 1886 a rule change was introduced, with the two halves being replaced by four ", "Sixty four species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nHuernia andreaeana -  Kenya\nHuernia barbata - South Africa\nHuernia campanulata\nHuernia clavigera - South Africa\nHuernia confusa -  Transvaal\nHuernia decemdentata - Cape Province\nHuernia distincta - Cape Province\nHuernia guttata\nHuernia hallii - Namibia\nHuernia humilis  - South Africa\nHuernia insigniflora - Transvaal\nHuernia kennedyana - South Africa\nHuernia kirkii - Cape Province\nHuernia levyi - Zimbabwe\nHuernia loeseneriana - South Africa\nHuernia longii - Cape Province\nHuernia longituba - Cape Province\nHuernia lopanthera - Angola\nHuernia macrocarpa (Huernia penzigii)\nHuernia mccoyi - Yemen\nHuernia namaquensis -  Little Namaqualand\nHuernia nouhuysii - Transvaal\nHuernia ocellata\nHuernia oculata - South Africa\nHuernia pendula - Cape Province\nHuernia piersii - Cape Province\nHuernia pillansii - South Africa\nHuernia plowesii - Namibia\nHuernia praestans  - Cape Province\nHuernia primulina - South Africa\nHuernia procumbens -  Transvaal\nHuernia quinta - South Africa\nHuernia reticulata - South Africa\nHuernia schneideriana - Southeastern Africa\nHuernia similis - Angola\nHuernia simplex - South Africa\nHuernia stapelioides - South Africa\nHuernia tanganyikensis - Tanzania\nHuernia thudichumii - Cape Province\nHuernia thureti - South Africa\nHuernia transvaalensis -  Transvaal\nHuernia tubata - South Africa\nHuernia urceolata - Angola, Namibia\nHuernia venusta\nHuernia volkartii - Angola\nHuernia whitesloaneana -  Transvaal\nHuernia witzenbergensis - Cape Province\nHuernia zebrina - Cape Province\nformerly included\nmoved to Angolluma\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri", "The scuba set can be carried by the diver in several ways. The two most common basic mounting configurations are back-mount and side-mount, and back-mount may be expanded to include auxiliary side-mounting, including bungee-constrained low profile side-mount, and the less compact sling-mount or stage-mount arrangement.\nMost common for recreational diving is the stabilizer jacket harness, in which a single cylinder, or occasionally twins, is strapped to the jacket style buoyancy compensator which is used as the harness. Some jacket style harnesses allow a bailout or decompression cylinder to be sling mounted from D-rings on the harness. A bailout cylinder can also be strapped to the side of the main back-mounted cylinder.\nAnother popular configuration is the backplate and wing arrangement, which uses a back inflation buoyancy compensator bladder sandwiched between a rigid backplate and the main gas cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement is particularly popular with twin or double cylinder sets, and can be used to carry larger sets of three or four cylinders and most rebreathers. Additional cylinders for decompression can be sling mounted at the diver's sides.\nIt is also possible to use a plain backpack harness to support the set, either with a horse-collar buoyancy compensator, or without any buoyancy compensator. This was the standard arrangement before the introduction of the buoyancy compensator, and is still used by some recreational and professional divers when it suits the diving operation.\nSurface-supplied divers are generally required to carry an emergency gas supply, also known as a bailout set, which is usually back-mounted open circuit scuba connected into the breathing gas supply system by connecting an interstage hose to the gas switching block, (or bailout block), mounted on the side of the helmet or full-face mask, or on the diver's harness where it can easily be reached, but is unlikely to be accidentally opened. Other mounting arrangements may be used for special circumstances.\nSide-mount harnesses support the cylinders by clipping them to D-rings at chest and hip on either or both sides, and the cylinders hang roughly parallel to the diver's torso when underwater. The harness usually includes a buoyancy compensator bladder. It is possible for a skilled diver to carry up to 3 cylinders on each side with this system.\nAn unusual configuration which does not appear to have become popular is the integrated harness and storage container. These units comprise a bag which contains the buoyancy bladder and the cylinder, with a harness and regulator components which are stored in the bag and unfolded to the working position when the bag is unzipped. Some military rebreathers such as the Interspiro DCSC also store the breathing hoses inside the housing when not in use.\nTechnical divers may need to carry several different gas mixtures. These are intended to be used at different stages of the planned dive profile, and for safety reasons it is necessary for the diver to be able to check which gas is in use at any given depth and time, and to open and close the supply valves when required, so the gases are generally carried in fully self-contained independent scuba sets, which are suspended from the harness at the diver's sides. This arrangement is known as stage mounting. Stage sets may be cached along a penetration guideline to be retrieved during exit for convenience. These are also sometimes called drop tanks.", "Andrew Bazzi (born August 28, 1997), known mononymously as Bazzi (/\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0zi/ BAH-zee), is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer.

The committee identified an undeveloped portion of the city's Metropolitan Tract, a downtown area covering four blocks, as an ideal location for a new hotel. The Tract was also known as Denny's Knoll, after Arthur A. Denny, one of Seattle's founders, who had donated the land for the Territorial University, which would later become the University of Washington.\nThe university had relocated to a campus north of Portage Bay in 1895, but still owned the downtown tract of land.

Educated women could find opportunities of leadership only in religious convents (such as Clare of Assisi and Catherine of Siena).\nThe Renaissance (15th\u201316th centuries) challenged conventional customs from the Medieval period. Women were still confined to the roles of \"monaca, moglie, serva, cortigiana\" (\"nun, wife, servant, courtesan\"). However, literacy spread among upper-class women in Italy and a growing number of them stepped out into the secular intellectual circles. Venetian-born Christine de Pizan wrote The City of Ladies in 1404, and in it she described women's gender as having no innate inferiority to men's, although being born to serve the other sex. Some women were able to gain an education on their own, or received tutoring from their father or husband.\nLucrezia Tornabuoni in Florence; Veronica Gambara at Correggio; Veronica Franco and Moderata Fonte in Venice; and Vittoria Colonna in Rome were among the renowned women intellectuals of the time. Powerful women rulers of the Italian Renaissance, such as Isabella d'Este, Catherine de' Medici, or Lucrezia Borgia, combined political skill with cultural interests and patronage. Unlike her peers, Isabella di Morra (an important poet of the time) was kept a virtual prisoner in her own castle and her tragic life makes her a symbol of female oppression.\nBy the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Italian women intellectuals were embraced by contemporary culture as learned daughters, wives, mothers, and equal partners in their household. Among them were composers Francesca Caccini and Leonora Baroni, and painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Outside the family setting, Italian women continued to find opportunities in the convent, and now increasingly also as singers in the theatre (Anna Renzi\u2014described as the first diva in the history of opera\u2014and Barbara Strozzi are two examples). In 1678, Elena Cornaro Piscopia was the first woman in Italy to receive an academical degree, in philosophy, from the University of Padua.\nIn the 18th-century, the Enlightenment offered for the first time to Italian women (such as Laura Bassi, Cristina Roccati, Anna Morandi Manzolini, and Maria Gaetana Agnesi) the possibility to engage in the fields of science and mathematics.

Christie got as far as arranging that the collection should be made over to him upon the deposit of 100,000 guineas in the Bank of England, before the negotiations collapsed when the Prince of Wales having subscribed his name in the book for 7,000 guineas, and his brothers the dukes of York and Clarence for 5,000 each, no further subscribers were to be found. It was Dawson Turner's opinion that the failure was owing to the general sense that at the division of the spoils the lion's share would go to the royals.\nIn 1792 Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9 impulsively sold the collection en bloc to a banker of Brussels who immediately sold it at a huge profit to the enlightened connoisseur Jean-Joseph de Laborde de M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, who set about adding a gallery to house it attached to his h\u00f4tel in rue d'Artois. Ruined by events, he was forced to sell it once more.\nThe 147 German, Dutch and Flemish paintings were sold by Orl\u00e9ans to Thomas Moore Slade, a British dealer, in a syndicate with two London bankers and the 7th Lord Kinnaird, for 350,000 livres in 1792, and taken to London for sale.  There were protests from the French artists and public, and from the Duke's creditors, and Slade found it prudent to tell the French the pictures were going overland to Calais, but actually to sneak them onto a barge by night, and ship them down the Seine to Le Havre.  These paintings were exhibited for sale in London's West End in April 1793 at 125 Pall Mall, where admissions at 1 shilling each reached two thousand a day, and sold to various buyers.\nPhilippe \u00c9galit\u00e9, as he had renamed himself, was arrested in April 1793 and was guillotined 6 November, but in the meantime sale negotiations for the Italian and French paintings were renewed, and they were sold for 750,000 livres to \u00c9douard Walkiers, a banker of Brussels, who soon after sold them on, unpacked, to his cousin, Count Fran\u00e7ois-Louis-Joseph de Laborde-M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, who had hoped to use them to add to the French national collection.  After the start of the Terror, and the execution of his father as well as the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, Laborde-M\u00e9r\u00e9ville saw he had to escape France, and brought the collection to London in early 1793.\nThe French and Italian paintings then spent five years in London with Laborde-M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, the subject of some complicated financial manoeuvres, including the failure of an attempt supported by King George III and the Prime Minister Pitt the Younger to buy them for the nation.  They were finally bought in 1798 by a syndicate of the canal and coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, his nephew and heir, Earl Gower, later 1st Duke of Sutherland, and the Earl of Carlisle.  Gower, who was perhaps the prime mover and must have known the collection well from his time as British ambassador in Paris, contributed 1/8 of the \u00a343,500 price, Carlisle a quarter, and Bridgewater the remaining 5/8s.\nThe pictures were put on exhibition for seven months in 1798, with a view to selling at a least a part of them, in Bryan's Gallery in Pall Mall, with the larger ones at the Lyceum in the Strand; admission was 2/6d rather than the 1s. usual for such events.  On first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote \"I was staggered when I saw the works\u00a0... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\"   In 1798, 1800 and 1802 there were auctions of those paintings not sold via the galleries, generally achieving rather low prices, but 94 out of 305 of the paintings were retained by the syndicate, as seems always to have been intended, and these largely remain in their families today.

Besides this he continued with further studies under Max Reger in Leipzig. He laboured over his work on fugues, complaining to his godfather and mentor Cuno, Count of Moltke: \"The fugue might be an artistic composition and one can write beautiful music by means of the fugue, but it is nevertheless true slavery for the man gifted with fantasy.\" Reger, his teacher, to whom he also confided this sentiment, countered, \"When you have written 300 fugues, as I have, you will also be able to move freely within this form as within any other.\"\nApart from his diverse social life and wide circle of friends including, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Professor Arthur Nikisch, the artist continued to study the great philosophers and the different world religions. Through the family\u2019s acquaintance with Dr. Rudolf Steiner, who occasionally stayed at Liebenberg, Sigwart encountered Anthroposophy. In addition to studying the basic works of Anthroposophy, he often attended Steiner\u2019s lectures. together with his sisters Lycki and Tora, his brother Karl, and his sister-in-law Marie.\nIn the meanwhile Sigwart had come to know the Kammers\u00e4ngerin Helene Staegemann (1877\u20131923), daughter of the Leipzig theatre director Max Staegemann and his wife, the violinist Hildegard Kirchner. Her brother was the celebrated operatic baritone and actor Waldemar Staegemann and she came from the well-known artist family Devrient. Directly after having been instructed in Voice by her father, she began her stage career in Berlin, Vienna and Prague, becoming a celebrated interpreter of song compositions with composers such as Carl Reinecke und Hans Pfitzner dedicating compositions to her. She and Sigwart were married on 21 September 1909 in Leipzig.\nThe couple settled in Dresden, travelling extensively to Helene's musical engagements and occasional performances of Sigwart's compositions. He began a course of further instruction on the Organ with Albert Schweitzer, whom he sought out in Strassbourg and to whom he dedicated his composition for organ (op. 12). Then in May 1911 they undertook a journey through Greece and were deeply impressed by the holy places of antiquity. Sigwart made extensive notes in his diary, which he reworked musically on their return to Germany. His melodrama for orchestra The Funeral of Hector, with words taken from the Iliad (op. 15) was performed with considerable success in Leipzig and Dresden and led to a commission by the conductor and director of the Leipzig Conservatory, Arthur Nikisch (1855\u20131922), for a symphony for orchestra. For several years, however, Sigwart had been thinking about composing an opera. Having been alerted to the texts of Euripides by his early music teacher, Count Sporck, Sigwart withdrew for a period in 1912 and 1913 to his family residence Hertefeld Castle by the Rhine to work on it in solitude. The Songs of Euripides, as it was called, was accepted as a work in the spring of 1913 by the Staatstheater Stuttgart. After a labour of one and a half years, it was to be the only opera he composed, its completion coinciding with the birth of his only son Friedrich Max Donatus Sigwart on 19 February 1914.", "E. R.

It created a visual effect for the audience, and it was an integral part of the overall performance. Since the main visual appeal on stage were the costumes, they were often bright in colour and visually entrancing. Colours symbolized social hierarchy, and costumes were made to reflect that. For example, if a character was royalty, their costume would include purple. The colours, as well as the different fabrics of the costumes, allowed the audience to know the status of each character when they first appeared on stage.\nCostumes were collected in inventory. More often than not, costumes wouldn't be made individually to fit the actor. Instead, they would be selected out of the stock that theatre companies would keep. A theatre company reused costumes when possible and would rarely get new costumes made. Costumes themselves were expensive, so usually players wore contemporary clothing regardless of the time period of the play. The most expensive pieces were given to higher class characters because costuming was used to identify social status on stage. The fabrics within a playhouse would indicate the wealth of the company itself. The fabrics used the most were: velvet, satin, silk, cloth-of-gold, lace, and ermine. For less significant characters; actors would use their own clothes.\nActors also left clothes in their will for following actors to use. Masters would also leave clothes for servants in their will, but servants weren't allowed to wear fancy clothing, instead, they sold the clothes back to theatre companies. In the Elizabethan era, there was a law stating that certain classes could only wear clothing fitting of their status in society. There was a discrimination of status within the classes. Higher classes flaunted their wealth and power through the appearance of clothing, however, actors were the only exception. If actors belonged to a licensed acting company, they were allowed to dress above their standing in society for specific roles in a production.", "Mick Barry (born 17 September 1964) is an Irish politician  who is a member of the Socialist Party.

He began work as a clerk at the Bank of British North America in London, and was transferred to the Montreal branch in 1874 and the Ottawa branch in 1875. In 1876, he began work as an assistant in the Library of Parliament and discovered an interest in botany and entomology. He was one of the founding members of the Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club and a president of the Ottawa Horticultural Society. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1885.\nFletcher established a national reporting system to help identify and control the spread of insects and weeds harmful to agriculture. In 1887, he became the first Dominion Entomologist and Botanist attached to the Central Experimental Farm. He helped set up measures to control the spread of plant diseases and harmful insects from both within and outside Canada. He was a founder of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, now the Entomological Society of America, and a fellow of the Linnean Society of London. Fletcher also initiated the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids, and Nematodes (CNC).\nBesides his contributions to scientific journals and bulletins published by the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, he published with George H.

They often work in hospitals, healthcare centres and other service delivery points, but also in academic training, research, and administration. Some provide care and treatment services for patients in private homes. Many countries have a large number of community health workers who work outside formal healthcare institutions. Managers of healthcare services, health information technicians, and other assistive personnel and support workers are also considered a vital part of health care teams.\nHealthcare practitioners are commonly grouped into health professions.\nWithin each field of expertise, practitioners are often classified according to skill level and skill specialization. \u201cHealth professionals\u201d are highly skilled workers, in professions that usually require extensive knowledge including university-level study leading to the award of a first degree or higher qualification.

The 52-mile-long (84\u00a0km) river drains into the Salton Sea.\nThe New River, Alamo River, and Salton Sea of the 21st century started in autumn 1904, when the Colorado River, swollen by seasonal rainfall and snow-melt, flowed through a series of three human-engineered openings in the recently constructed levee bank of the Alamo Canal.  The resulting flood poured down the canal and breached an Imperial Valley dike.  The sudden influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea; the rivers had re-created a great inland sea in an area that it had frequently inundated before, the Salton Sink.\nIt took slightly less than two years (Mar 1905 to Feb 10, 1907)  to control the Colorado River\u2019s inflow to the Alamo Canal and stop the uncontrolled flooding of the Salton Sink, but the canal was effectively channelized with operational headgates by the early part of 1907. The Alamo and New Rivers continued to flow, but at a lesser rate.\nThe river was named after the Spanish name for the Fremont cottonwood that grows in the region.\nIn most places, the river is a vegetation-choked ravine with a small watercourse at the bottom.\nThe California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory based on mercury, DDTs, PCBs, and selenium.", "Some water canisters and similar canisters can be suitable for storing other liquids, like for example many types of acids, bases, salt solutions and oils.", "Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) was developed in response to the observation that the bulk of track maintenance work takes place at the joints. As steel production and manufacturing processes improved, the rail lengths installed were progressively increased, and the logical extension of this would be to eliminate the joints altogether.\nA major obstacle to doing so is thermal expansion: the rails expand in higher temperatures. Without joints, there is no room for the rails to expand; as the rails get warmer, they will develop an enormous force in trying to expand. If prevented from expanding, they develop a force of 1.7 tonnes (17\u00a0kN) for every 1 degree Celsius of temperature change in a practical rail section.\nIf a small cube of metal is compressed between the jaws of a press, it will contract\u2014that is it will be squashed somewhat\u2014and a very large force can be resisted by it without ultimate failure. However, if a long piece of metal of the same cross section is compressed, it will deform sideways into a bow shape; the process is called buckling, and the compressive force it can withstand is very much less.\nIf the long thin piece of metal could be constrained to prevent it from buckling (e.g. by being contained inside a tube) then it can resist a much higher compressive force. If the rails can be constrained in a similar way, they can be prevented from buckling. The weight of the track resists buckling upwards, so buckling is most likely to take place laterally. This is prevented by:\nproviding heavy sleepers, that generate friction on the ballast bed\nensuring that the sleepers are well supported on consolidated ballast to enable the generation of the friction\nproviding consolidated ballast around the sides of the sleepers to provide additional friction\nheating the rails when they are installed and fastened in cool or cold weather, so that the expansion on the hottest days is less than otherwise\nmaking sure that any rail added if rail breaks during cold weather is removed before warm weather returns.\nmaking sure that curves do not line themselves inward during cold weather sufficiently to make buckling more likely when warm weather returns\ntaking precautions when track maintenance work is performed in hot weather, and making sure ballast is sufficiently consolidated before full-speed operation is resumed.\nIf the rail is held so that it cannot expand at all, then there is no limit on the length of rail that can be handled.  (The expansive force in a one-foot length of rail at a certain temperature is the same as in a mile or 100 mile length of rail.)  Early continuous welded rail was installed in limited lengths only because of technological limitations. However at the end of the CWR section where it abutted older, ordinary jointed track, that track would be unable to resist the expansive force and the jointed track might be forced to buckle. To prevent that, special expansion switches, sometimes called breathers, were installed. The expansion switches could accommodate a considerable expansive movement\u2014typically four inches (100mm) or so\u2014in the end section of the CWR without passing the movement on to the jointed track.\nThe CWR is installed and fastened down at an optimum temperature, to ensure that the highest possible expansive force is limited. This temperature is called the stress-free temperature, and in the UK it is 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F). It is in the upper range of ordinary outdoor temperatures, and the actual installation work tends to be done at cooler temperatures. Originally the rails were physically heated to the stress-free temperature with propane gas heaters; they were then rattled with hand bars to eliminate any binding, preventing even expansion, and then clipped down. Since about 1963 however hydraulic jacks are used to physically stretch the rails while they are supported on temporary rollers. By stretching the rails to the length they would be if they were at the stress-free temperature, then there is no need to heat them; they can just be clipped down before the jacks are released.\nThe CWR rails are made by weldi", "The Cape is the only elevated plateau composed of limestone on the North West Coast.

Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet cellophane film to which the gel and a one percent glycerol solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50\u00a0\u00b0C.", "Born 20 February 1863, Davies was the second son of Mary Crompton and John Llewelyn Davies, Vicar of Kirkby Lonsdale. His father was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, an early alpinist who was the first ascendant of the third highest mountain in the Alps, and an outspoken foe of poverty and inequality active in Christian socialist groups. His sister was suffragist Margaret Llewelyn Davies. His niece was Theodora Llewelyn Davies, the first woman admitted to the British legal profession's Inner Temple in 1920.\nDavies attended Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was briefly a master at Eton College, but left that position to practice law.\nHe met Sylvia du Maurier (daughter of cartoonist George du Maurier and sister of future actor Gerald du Maurier) at a dinner party in 1889 and they became engaged shortly thereafter. He married her in 1892, and they had five children, all boys: George (1893\u20131915), Jack (1894\u20131959), Peter (1897\u20131960), Michael (1900\u20131921), and Nicholas (1903\u20131980).\nIn 1897, his pre-school sons George and Jack became friends with J.M. Barrie, whom they met during outings in Kensington Gardens with their nurse Mary Hodgson and their infant brother Peter. He and Sylvia then met Barrie and his wife Mary at a New Year's Eve dinner party that year, and she took up a close friendship with the writer as well. Although Davies did not encourage the ongoing friendship of his wife and sons with Barrie, and did not share their fondness for him, he did little to stand in the way of it. He permitted Barrie to spend considerable time at the Davies home, and for his family to visit with the Barries \u2013 who were childless \u2013 at their country cottage. During one of the holidays the families spent together, Barrie took a series of photographs of the boys' adventures, which he compiled into a photo book titled The Boy Castaways; Barrie gave one of the two copies printed to Davies, who misplaced it on a train.\nBarrie's 1901 novel The Little White Bird features characters inspired by Davies' family \u2013 a boy David in George's age range, and the boy's mother who resembles Sylvia \u2013 who are befriended by a thinly disguised version of the author. Barrie's play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, inspired by Davies' boys, debuted in December 1904. The chapters of The Little White Bird featuring Peter Pan were republished in 1906 as Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the dedication \"To Sylvia and Arthur Llewelyn Davies and their boys (my boys)\".\nIn 1904, the year when Barrie's play debuted, Davies moved with his family out of London when they purchased Egerton House, an Elizabethan mansion house in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. In 1906, he discovered a growth in his cheek which turned out to be a malignant sarcoma. He had two operations, which removed much of his upper jaw, palate, and cheekbone, and the tear duct on that side. This left him disfigured and unable to talk, even with an artificial jaw insert, but failed to remove all of the cancer and left him in considerable pain. Barrie, who had become wealthy from his books and plays, paid for his medical care, and became a regular companion at his bedside, especially in his final months. During this time, Davies described Barrie in a letter to his son Peter as \"a very good friend to all of us\". Family accounts differ on just how close the two actually became. Davies died at Egerton on 19 April 1907, at the age of 44.", "Goscote is a residential area of Walsall in the West Midlands of England. The Goscote name dates back several centuries and as recently as 1920 it was a rural area that had survived the recent Industrial Revolution which dramatically altered the face of the region.\nBut a mile or two away in Walsall town centre, hundreds of families were living in squalid and sub-standard housing. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, some 400 families had been rehoused to new council housing around Goscote, mostly around Goscote Lodge Crescent. Further new housing was developed by the council around Goscote after the war ended in 1945.\nHowever, Goscote was in serious decline towards the end of the 20th century with high crime rates. Demand for housing in the area became low, leading to an increase in the number of empty properties. Arson attacks were also a frequent occurrence.\nGoscote forms part of the Blakenall ward of Walsall, which also includes Blakenall Heath, Harden and Coal Pool, which was earmarked for major regeneration in 2001 as part of the government's New Deal initiative to regenerate some of the country's most deprived areas. \nIn May 2004, Walsall council unveiled plans to demolish nearly 900 homes in the Blakenall area, with the area around Goscote Lodge Crescent featuring on the shortlist of properties for possible demolition. These also included a large section of 1930s council housing around Harden and Blakenall Heath, although eventually some of the properties at risk of demolition were later selected for refurbishment.\nIn January 2007, the local council confirmed that it intended to demolish 281 interwar properties in Goscote Lodge Crescent, Hildicks Crescent and Middle Crescent and Hildicks Place. By this stage, several houses on the estate had already been demolished due to attacks by vandals and arsonists while they were empty. 103 of the 281 condemned houses were already empty.By April 2008, just over 20 families remained on the condemned estate, which the remaining residents were now comparing to war-torn Basra in Iraq due to increased arson, looting and vandalism. Some of the empty properties had already been demolished by this stage, and within a year almost all of the estate had been demolished.The final resident left the estate in July 2011, enabling the demolition to be completed. Plans for 808 new homes on the estate were announced at the end of that year, with construction work beginning in 2018.", "The Romanian Athenaeum (Romanian: Ateneul Rom\u00e2n) is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, Romania and a landmark of the Romanian capital city.

Generally, KCN or its less toxic surrogate Zn(CN)\u2082 are used as nucleophilic cyanide sources. To further diminish toxicity concerns, potassium ferricyanide has also been used as a cyanide source. Catalytic cycles are believed to proceed through a standard Pd (0/II) pathway with reductive elimination forging the key C-C bond. Deactivation of Pd(II) with excess cyanide is a common problem. Palladium catalysis conditions for aryl iodides, bromides, and even chlorides have been developed:\nNickel-catalyzed cyanations avoid the use of precious metals, and can take advantage of benzyl cyanide or acetonitrile as a cyanide source, via reductive C-C bond cleavage:\nSandmeyer cyanation is a means of converting aniline derivatives to benzonitriles. The cyanation is generally postulated to be two-electron, while with radical mediators in absence of metals, the reaction is likely radical.", "The word \"brassiere\" was gradually shortened to \"bra\" in the 1930s. According to a 1934 survey by Harper's Bazaar, \"bra\" was the most commonly used expression for the garment among college women. The bra was becoming more sophisticated, and home-sewn versions vanished in the 1930s. In October 1932, the S.H. Camp and Company correlated the size and pendulousness of a woman's breasts to letters of the alphabet, A through D. Camp's advertising featured letter-labeled profiles of breasts in the February 1933 issue of Corset and Underwear Review. In 1937, Warner began to feature cup sizing in its products. Two other companies, Model and Fay-Miss, began to offer A, B, C and D cups in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium and Large through the 1940s. Adjustable bands were introduced using multiple eye and hook positions in the 1930s.\nAs with other women's products, consumer adoption was encouraged by successful advertising and marketing campaigns. Saleswomen played a key role, helping clients find the right garment, as did the changing role of women in society. Much of this marketing was aimed at young women.\nBras rapidly became a major industry over the 1930s, with improvements in fiber technology, fabrics, colours, patterns, and options, and did much better than the retail industry in general. Innovations included Warners' use of elastic, the adjustable strap, the sized cup, and padded bras for smaller-breasted women. In the US production moved outside of New York and Chicago, and advertising started to exploit Hollywood glamour and become more specialised. Department stores developed fitting areas, and customers, stores and manufacturers all benefited. Manufacturers even arranged fitting training courses for saleswomen. International sales started to form an increasing part of the U.S. bra manufacturer's market. Prices started to make bras available to a wider market, and home-made competition dwindled. Other major manufacturers of the 1930s included Triumph, Maidenform, Gossard, (Courtaulds), Spirella, Spencer, Twilfit, and Symington.\nThe culturally preferred silhouette among Western women during the 1930s was a pointy bust, which further increased demand for a forming garment.", "An exploded view drawing is a type of drawing, that shows the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. It shows all parts of the assembly and how they fit together. In mechanical systems usually the component closest to the center are assembled first, or is the main part in which the other parts get assembled. This drawing can also help to represent the disassembly of parts, where the parts on the outside normally get removed first.\nExploded diagrams are common in descriptive manuals showing parts placement, or parts contained in an assembly or sub-assembly.  Usually such diagrams have the part identification number and a label indicating which part fills the particular position in the diagram.  Many spreadsheet applications can automatically create exploded diagrams, such as exploded pie charts.\nIn patent drawings in an exploded views the separated parts should be embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts are permissible, see image. When an exploded view is shown in a figure that is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded view should be placed in brackets.\nExploded views can also be used in architectural drawing, for example in the presentation of landscape design. An exploded view can create an image in which the elements are flying through the air above the architectural plan, almost like a cubist painting. The locations can be shadowed or dotted in the siteplan of the elements.", "John Naimbanna (17??\u20131793) was a Temne Prince who visited London in 1791\u20131793.\nJohn was the son of Naimbanna II, the Obai (King) of the Temne people of Robanna, near Sierra Leone. The king had three sons and resolved to send one each to Britain, Portugal and the Ottoman Empire to study Protestantism, Catholicism and Islam respectively. Thus in 1791 John was sent to England on the small merchant sloop Lapwing. There he came under the tutelage of the reformer Henry Thornton. While in London he became a Christian, adopting the forenames Henry and Granville to honour Henry Thornton and Granville Sharp.\nNaimbanna died of unknown causes in July 1793.", "The location of the old Central Station south of the current station can be seen in two long, straight roads in the central city. Stephanstra\u00dfe is at the location of the first station in Stuttgart and at the eastern half of the second station on the same site, Lautenschlagerstra\u00dfe is at the location of the western half of the second station. Both streets were opened and named in 1925, after the building of the current Central Station.

The name stems from the water's white-gray color, a function of eroded sand, clay, and volcanic ash carried by the river from its source near the Badlands. Draining a basin of about 10,200 square miles (26,000\u00a0km\u00b2), about 8,500 square miles (22,000\u00a0km\u00b2) of which is in South Dakota, the stream flows through a region of sparsely populated hills, plateaus, and badlands.\nThe White River rises in northwestern Nebraska, in the Pine Ridge escarpment north of Harrison, at an elevation of 4,861 feet (1,482\u00a0m) above sea level. It flows southeast then northeast past Fort Robinson and north of Crawford. It crosses into southwestern South Dakota and flows north across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, then northeast, receiving Wounded Knee Creek and flowing between units of Badlands National Park. It flows east-northeast and southeast at the northern edge of the reservation, forming the northern boundary of the reservation and the southern boundary of Buffalo Gap National Grassland. It receives the Little White River about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) south of Murdo, and flows east to join the Missouri in Lake Francis Case about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) southwest of Chamberlain.\nThe river sometimes has no surface flow due to the dry climate surrounding its badlands and prairie basin, though thunderstorms can cause brief intense flow. The river near Chamberlain flows year-round. As of 2001, the White River had generally good-quality water.", "Sinigaglia was born at Como the son of Antonio Sinigaglia and his wife Antoinette. His parents ran a restaurant, but his father emigrated to South America and never returned. He was educated at Gaius Plinius Technical Institute and was a member of Pool Comense 1872 until 1903 when he was expelled for indiscipline. He  then joined Canottieri Lario. In 1907 he won the Italian championship in a coxed pair. In 1911 he was Italian and European Champion in the single scull and in the double scull with Teodoro Mariani.  In 1914, Sinigaglia won the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley beating Colin Stuart in the final.\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, Sinigaglia volunteered into the Royal Italian Army and was assigned to  the 2nd Regiment Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade. After a period of training he took part in the offensive against Monte Sabotino and Monte Podgora. In 1916 he was promoted to lieutenant and served in the Battle of Asiago. He later took part in the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo at Monte San Michele and Gorizia. On 9 August 1916, Sinigaglia led his men in an attack on Hill 4 of Monte San Michele. He was hit by Austrian fire and was transported the hospital at San Vito al Torre where he died the next day.\nSinigaglia was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor. The stadium Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia was named in his honour.", "The Cincinnati Gymnasium and Athletic Club is a historic building in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.  Located on Shillito Place in the city's downtown, it was built for a club of the same name.  Founded in 1853 by a group of Cincinnati elites, including Rutherford B. Hayes, the society chose to erect a new headquarters in 1902; at the time of its completion, this four-story building was hailed as one of the country's best athletic facilities, second only to the gymnasium at Columbia University in New York City.\nA Second Renaissance Revival building designed by John Scudder Adkins of the firm Werner and Adkins, the building is built of brick with stone and metal elements.  Among these elements are rusticated stone courses, a molded balustrade, and trimmed windows.  In recognition of its distinctive and historically significant architecture, the club building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.", "The ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as alpha, beta, gamma, and X-rays. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an \"ion pair\"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The ionization chamber is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas through the application of an electric field.\nThe Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube and the proportional counter both use a phenomenon known as a Townsend avalanche to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.", "Life may have developed in the crater since it is believed the lake was long-lived; the delta may have required a period of 10\u2076\u201310\u2077 years to form. Clay minerals have been detected in and around the crater.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified smectite clays.  Clays form in the presence of water, so this area probably once held water and maybe life in ancient times.  The surface in places is cracked into polygonal patterns.  Such shapes often form when clay dries out.  These patterns can be seen in the image below.  The image shows a channel that carried water and sediments into Jezero crater.\nResearchers described in a paper, released in March 2015, how an ancient Martian lake system existed in  Jezero Crater.  The study advanced the idea that water filled the crater at least two separate times.  There are two channels on the northern and western sides of the crater that probably supplied it with water; each of these channels has a delta-like deposit where sediment was carried by water and deposited in the lake.  Craters of a given diameter are expected to have a certain depth; a depth less than expected means sediment has entered the crater.  Calculations suggest that the crater may hold about one kilometer of sediments.  Most of the sediments may have been brought in by channels.", "John Birks \"Dizzy\" Gillespie was born October 21, 1917 in Cheraw, South Carolina and died January 6, 1993.

However, only certain cycloadditions are allowed under thermal conditions according to the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules of orbital symmetry, or other equivalent models such as frontier molecular orbital theory (FMO) or the Dewar-Zimmermann model. Cycloadditions that are not thermally allowed, such as the [2+2] cycloaddition, can be enabled by photochemical activation of the reaction. Under uncatalyzed conditions, this activation requires the use of high energy ultraviolet light capable of altering the orbital populations of the reactive compounds. Alternatively, metal catalysts such as cobalt and copper have been reported to catalyze thermally-forbidden [2+2] cycloadditions via single electron transfer.\nThe required change in orbital populations can be achieved by electron transfer with a photocatalyst sensitive to lower energy visible light. Yoon demonstrated the efficient intra- and intermolecular [2+2] cycloadditions of activated olefins: particularly enones and styrenes. Enones, or electron-poor olefins, were discovered to react via a radical-anion pathway, utilizing diisopropylethylamine as a transient source of electrons. For this electron-transfer, [Ru(bipy)\u2083]\u00b2\u207a was discovered to be an efficient photocatalyst. The anionic nature of the cyclization proved to be crucial: performing the reaction in acid rather than with a lithium counterion favored a non-cycloaddition pathway. Zhao et al. likewise discovered that a still different cyclization pathway is available to chalcones with a samarium counterion. Conversely, electron-rich styrenes were found to react via a radical-cation mechanism, utilizing methyl viologen or molecular oxygen as a transient electron sink. While [Ru(bipy)\u2083]\u00b2\u207a proved to be a competent catalyst for intramolecular cyclizations using methyl viologen, it could not be used with molecular oxygen as an electron sink or for intermolecular cyclizations. For intermolecular cyclizations, Yoon et al. discovered that the more strongly oxidizing photocatalyst [Ru(bpm)\u2083]\u00b2\u207a and molecular oxygen provided a catalytic system better suited to access the radical cation necessary for the cycloaddition to occur. [Ru(bpz)\u2083]\u00b2\u207a, a still more strongly oxidizing photocatalyst, proved to be problematic because although it could catalyze the desired [2+2] cycloaddition, it was also strong enough to oxidize the cycloadduct and catalyze the retro-[2+2] reaction. This comparison of photocatalysts highlights the importance of tuning the redox properties of a photocatalyst to the reaction system as well as demonstrating the value of polypyridyl compounds as ligands, due to the ease with which they can be modified to adjust the redox properties of their complexes.\nPhotoredox-catalyzed [2+2] cycloadditions can also be effected with a triphenylpyrylium organic photoredox catalyst.\nIn addition to the thermally-forbidden [2+2] cycloaddition, photoredox catalysis can be applied to the [4+2] cyclization (Diels\u2013Alder reaction). Bis-enones, similar to the substrates used for the photoredox [2+2] cyclization, but with a longer linker joining the two enone functional groups, undergo intramolecular radical-anion hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reactions more rapidly than [2+2] cycloaddition.\nSimilarly, electron-rich styrenes participate in intra- or intermolecular Diels\u2013Alder cyclizations via a radical cation mechanism. [Ru(bipy)\u2083]\u00b2\u207a was a competent catalyst for intermolecular, but not intramolecular, Diels\u2013Alder cyclizations. This photoredox-catalyzed Diels\u2013Alder reaction allows cycloaddition between two electronically mismatched substrates. The normal electronic demand for the Diels\u2013Alder reaction calls for an electron-rich diene to react with an electron-poor olefin (or \"dienophile\"), while the inverse electron-demand Diels\u2013Alder reaction takes place between the opposite case o", "Saviore dell'Adamello (Camunian: Savi\u00far) is a comune in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy.\nIt is bounded by the commune of Cevo.

Nowadays it is the oldest villa in Kaivopuisto and the embassy of the Netherlands to Finland.\nThe building is located at It\u00e4inen Puistotie 7 and was built for the Ullanlinna bath house guests. The lot was handed over in 1839 and the building is assumed to have been finished during the next year. It is unsure who the architect is, but some sources mention Carl Ludvig Engel and his student Jean Wik. It has also been argued that C.A. Edelfelt was the architect, but at the time the building was being finished, Edelfelt hadn\u2019t started his career yet.\nThe \u201cBath- and wellhouse\u201d corporation by Viktor Hartwall, A.W. Astenius and J.A. Decker took the initiative of building the house. They let it to guests of the bathhouses during summers. In 1857 restaurateur Louis Kleineh bought the house for personal use and it remained family property until 1928. From that time on the house is being called \u201cVilla Kleineh\u201d.\nThe architecture of the house was representative of the Empire style. This was further expanded by Jean Wik in 1858 and Theodor Decker in 1872. More modifications have been made during the years 1882, 1889 and 1914. In 1928 the director of Nobel Standard, Leopold Lerche, bought the villa. During the next year he had Birger Bederley make more and larger modifications than ever before. During that time Villa Kleineh got its classicist look that it now still has.\nLerche died in 1929 and in 1954 the family of his widow's children inherited the villa. Their family name was Adlercreutz and for that reason the villa got its second name \u201cVilla Adlercreutz\u201d. \nAfter the Second World War the villa was in use of the British delegation of the Allied Commission. The villa and its garden are protected from 1965 on. After the passing away in 1989 of the last resident of the villa, Henrik Adlercreutz, the building became property of a developer and it remained mostly empty. The later owner Merita-bank let the villa in 1998 as a residence to the ambassador of the Netherlands. Two years later it was sold to the Netherlands state. The ambassador is a resident of the villa since November 1999.\nIn the movie \u201cKaivopuiston kaunis Regina\u201d (1941) the house functions as the summer house of monarch Popoff.

The Niagara Scenic Parkway in Niagara Falls, New York was originally named the Robert Moses State Parkway in his honor; its name was changed in 2016. A hydro-electric power dam in Massena, New York also bears Moses' name. Moses also has a school named after him in North Babylon, New York on Long Island; there is also a Robert Moses Playground in New York City.

A spring freshet can sometimes last several weeks on large river systems, resulting in significant inundation of flood plains as the snowpack melts in the river's watershed. Freshets can occur with differing strength and duration depending upon the depth of the snowpack and the local average rates of warming temperatures. Deeper snowpacks which melt quickly can result in more severe flooding. Late spring melts allow for faster flooding; this is because the relatively longer days and higher solar angle allow for average melting temperatures to be reached quickly, causing snow to melt rapidly. Snowpacks at higher altitudes and in mountainous areas remain cold and tend to melt over a longer period of time and thus do not contribute to major flooding. Serious flooding from southern freshets are more often related to rain storms of large tropical weather systems rolling in from the South Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, to add their powerful heating capacity to lesser snow packs. Tropically induced rainfall influenced quick melts can also affect snow cover to latitudes as far north as southern Canada, so long as the generally colder air mass is not blocking northward movement of low pressure systems.\nIn the eastern part of the continent, annual freshets occur from the Canadian Taiga ranging along both sides of the Great Lakes then down through the heavily forested Appalachian mountain chain and St. Lawrence valley from Northern Maine into barrier ranges in North Carolina and Tennessee.\nIn the western part of the continent, freshets occur throughout the generally much higher elevations of the various west coast mountain ranges that extend southward down from Alaska even into the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico.\nThe term can also refer to the following:\nA flood resulting from heavy rain or a spring thaw.  Whereas heavy rain often causes a flash flood, a spring thaw event is generally a more incremental process, depending upon local climate and topography.\nA stream, river or flood of fresh water which empties into the ocean, usually flowing through an estuary.\nA small stream of fresh water, irrespective of its outflow.\nA pool of fresh water, according to Samuel Johnson and followed in Thomas Sheridan's dictionary, but this might have been a misinterpretation on Johnson's part, and it is at best not a common usage.", "Phosphoribosylamine (5PRA) is an intermediate in purine metabolism.

Taiwanese independence was advocated periodically during the Japanese colonial period, but was suppressed by the Japanese government. These efforts were the goal of the Taiwanese Communist Party of the late 1920s. Unlike current formulations, and in line with the thinking of the Comintern, such a state would have been a proletarian one. With the end of World War II in 1945, Japanese rule ended, but the subsequent autocratic rule of the ROC's Kuomintang (KMT) later revived calls for local rule. However, it was a movement supported by the Chinese students who were born on the Island and not associated with KMT. It found its roots in the US and Japan. In the 1950s a Republic of Taiwan Provisional Government was set up in Japan. Thomas Liao was nominally the President. At one time it held quasi-official relations with the newly independent Indonesia. This was possible mainly through the connections between Sukarno and the Provisional Government's Southeast Asian liaison, Chen Chih-hsiung, who had assisted in Indonesia's local resistance movements against the Japanese rule.\nAfter the Kuomintang began to rule the island, the focus of the movement was as a vehicle for discontent from the native Taiwanese against the rule of \"mainlanders\" (i.e. mainland Chinese-born people who fled to Taiwan with KMT in the late 1940s). The February 28 Incident in 1947 and the ensuing martial law that lasted until 1987 contributed to the period of White Terror on the island. In 1979, the Kaohsiung Incident, occurred as the movement for democracy and independence intensified.\nBetween 1949 and 1991, the official position of the ROC government on Taiwan was that it was the legitimate government of all of China and it used this position as justification for authoritarian measures such as the refusal to vacate the seats held by delegates elected on the mainland in 1947 for the Legislative Yuan. The Taiwan independence movement intensified in response to this and presented an alternative vision of a sovereign and independent Taiwanese state. This vision was represented through a number of symbols such as the use of Taiwanese in opposition to the school-taught Mandarin Chinese.\nSeveral scholars drafted various versions of a constitution, as both political statement or vision and as intellectual exercise. Most of these drafts favor a bicameral parliamentary rather than presidential system. In at least one such draft, seats in the upper house would be divided equally among Taiwan's established ethnicities. In the 1980s the Chinese Nationalist government considered publication of these ideas criminal. In the most dramatic case, it decided to arrest the pro-independence publisher Cheng Nan-jung for publishing a version in his Tang-wai magazine, Liberty Era Weekly (\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u4ee3\u9031\u520a). Rather than giving himself up, Cheng self-immolated in protest. Other campaigns and tactics toward such a State have included soliciting designs from the public for a new national flag (see images to the right) and anthem (for example, Taiwan the Formosa). More recently the Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign (\u53f0\u7063\u6b63\u540d\u904b\u52d5) has played an active role. More traditional independence supporters, however, have criticized name rectification as merely a superficial tactic devoid of the larger vision inherent in the independence agenda.\nVarious overseas Taiwan Independence movements, such as the Formosan Association, World United Formosans for Independence, United Young Formosans for Independence (Japan), Union for Formosa's Independence in Europe, United Formosans in America for Independence, Committee for Human Rights in Formosa (Toronto, Ont.), published \"The Independent Formosa\" in several volumes with the publisher \"Formosan Association.\" In \"The Independent Formosa, Volumes 2-3\", they tried to justify Taiwanese collaboration with Japan during World War II by saying that the \"atmosphere covered the whole Japanese territories, includin", "The 44th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, consisting of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.

It was issued with 36 US-pattern Bofors guns and a few vehicles, and attended a practice camp near Alexandria. It now came under the command of 2 AA Bde, which was assigned a role in the planned Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). First, in early June the guns and equipment were shipped to Haifa in Palestine and Beirut in Lebanon, then the personnel entrained for Suez, where on 30 June 175 and 176 LAA Btys boarded HM Transports Empire Trooper and Duchess of Bedford, while the main body (RHQ, REME, Royal Signals and 276 LAA Bty) boarded the Orbita. These transports steamed up the Suez Canal to Alexandria, where the men were given four days ashore before re-embarking and joining the convoy to Sicily, which included the transports from Haifa and Lebanon.\nThe regiment watched the bombardment of Syracuse from its transports on D Day (10 July) and a reconnaissance party landed at the town after its capture next day. The regiment began landing on 13 July, when 176 LAA Bty immediately deployed 12 guns to defend the port; these were in action that night. Further guns were landed and deployed on 14 July, in time for the regiment to fire about 3000 rounds each night against heavy air raids on 14/15 and 15/16 July. By the end of 16 July the whole regiment was ashore and setting up defensive barrages in conjunction with the AA Defence Commander (AADC) and AA Operations Room (AAOR). That night another 10,000 rounds were fired against aircraft dropping Parachute mines in the harbour. Enemy air activity over Syracuse declined somewhat as Eighth Army pressed north and captured Augusta, though one attack on 24/25 July set a ship on fire in the harbour, and groups of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s dive-bombed the harbour in daylight. A Troop of 276 LAA Bty had already moved north to provide AA defence for Eighth Army HQ. 2 AA Brigade HQ also went to Augusta, leaving 66th LAA Rgt under the command of newly-arrived 62 AA Bde HQ.\nThe regiment spent August defending Syracuse against 'slight air activity' while the ground troops completed the capture of Sicily and prepared for the assault crossing of the Straits of Messina (Operation Baytown) on 3 September. Once Eighth Army was established on the 'toe' of Italy, 276 LAA Bty was moved up, first on 17 September to defend Messina, and then back to Augusta. The war having moved on, the regiment caught up on some training, including anti-tank practice, while the rear parties and transport arrived from Egypt. In November it carried out mobile training. By now the regiment was under the command of the Royal Marines' Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation (MNBDO). When this too was closed down and 73 AA Bde took over at the beginning of January 1944, 66th LAA Rgt was redeployed, with 175 LAA Bty covering Gerbini Airfield, 176 in Syracuse, and 276 at Catania Airfield, while RHQ and the REME workshop moved from Syracuse to Catania.", "An auto-da-f\u00e9 (from Portuguese auto da f\u00e9 [\u02c8aw.tu d\u0250 \u02c8f\u025b], meaning 'act of faith') was the ritual of public penance carried out between the 15th and 19th centuries of condemned heretics and apostates imposed by the Spanish, Portuguese, or Mexican Inquisition as punishment and enforced by civil authorities.

Two-member rock and pop bands typically omit one of these musical elements. In many cases, two-member bands omit a drummer, since guitars, bass guitars, and keyboards can all be used to provide a rhythmic pulse.\nOther examples of two-member bands are Pet Shop Boys, Hella, Flight of the Conchords, the Ting Tings, Hall & Oates, Twenty One Pilots, and T.

Sequencers allowed bands to program some elements of their performance, such as an electronic drum part and a synth bass line. Two-member pop music bands such as Soft Cell, Blancmange, and Yazoo used programmed sequencers. Other pop bands from the 1980s, who were ostensibly fronted by two performers, such as Wham!, Eurythmics, and Tears for Fears, were not actually two-piece ensembles, because other instrumental musicians were used \"behind the scenes\" to fill out the sound.

In the pilot episode, the Spindrift is en route from Los Angeles to London, on an ultra fast sub-orbital flight. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the Spindrift encounters a magnetic space storm, and is dragged through a space warp to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than on Earth, whose inhabitants the Earthlings nickname \"the Giants\". The Spindrift crash-lands, and the damage renders it inoperable.\nVery little is known about the home planet of the Giants. This is partially because the Spindrift crew very seldom leave the area where their spaceship crashed in the opening episode. Only two other (unidentified) giant societies are ever seen, in the episodes \"The Land of the Lost\" and \"The Secret City of Limbo\".\nNo name is ever established for the mysterious planet, but the inhabitants know of Earth, Venus, and Mars, referring to them by name in one episode. Exactly where the planet is located is also never made clear. In the episode \"On a Clear Night You Can See Earth\", Captain Steve Burton (Gary Conway) claims to have seen Earth through a set of infrared goggles invented by the giants, implying that the two planets are near enough to see one from the other. The only established method by which Earth people may reach the giants' planet is high-altitude flight, passing through what one giant calls a \"dimension lock\".\nAlthough various episodes establish that at least six other flights have landed on the planet, no episode confirms anyone ever returning to Earth. The first mention of other visitors from Earth was in episode 2, \"Ghost Town\", in which another ship was said to have crashed long ago without any survivors. In episode 4, \"Underground\", another Earth ship is described as crashing three years previously, again with no survivors.\nSeveral episodes show crews surviving their initial crashes, only to be killed later. The episode \"Brainwash\" has a crew of little people surviving long enough to build a radio station that can communicate with Earth. They are killed shortly after that. The episodes \"Golden Cage\" and \"The Lost Ones\" show there have been a few survivors of other crashes. Only the Spindrift crew seems to have survived for long with its party intact.\nOne continent, or hemisphere, is dominated by an authoritarian government which tolerates full freedoms within a capitalist system, but it does not tolerate any effort to effect political change. Exactly what the political situation is on other continents is not known, although at least one overseas land has a despotic ruler. The Air Traffic Control tells those who venture out to sea that they should turn back, that nothing beyond that sea has been explored nor is there current contact; whether this is an official government line or the truth is not known.\nCulturally, the Giant society closely resembles the contemporary United States of 1968 (in various episodes it has a police force, private hospitals, prisons, a State Governor, radio and television services, a zoo, jazz clubs, even a racetrack \u2013 and the Giants speak English, drive American cars, attend Vaudeville-style theatres, and play chess). The Earth people find themselves able to cope, and their efforts to get around are facilitated by the ubiquity of large drains leading directly from interior rooms to the pavement, in an outside wall of most buildings. The Giant government has offered a reward for the capture of the small Earth people (whom the Giants call the little people).\nIn spite of the authoritarianism, there are several dissident movements at work that either help other dissenters (such as the Earth people) or are actively working to unseat the ruling party. The government has established the Special Investigations Department (SID) to deal with assorted dissidents but it also takes the lead in dealing with the Earth people. The Giant technology mostly resembles mid-20th century Earth, but inconsistently: significantly", "Cristian David Lucchetti (born 26 June 1978) is an Argentine football goalkeeper.

He was an effective, if sometimes somewhat bad-tempered minister. He chose to return to Parliament on the formation of the Van Agt-government in 1977, becoming senior deputy parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the alliance between the KVP and the other two main Christian parties. His career got an unexpected boost when the leader of the parliamentary faction of the CDA, Willem Aantjes, had to resign in 1978 because of accusations that he had served in the Germanic-SS during the Second World War. Lubbers succeeded him and suddenly found himself in a powerful political position.\nIn 1982, after the general election won by Prime Minister Dries van Agt, a similar thing happened when Van Agt suddenly announced he would not serve for a third term. Lubbers took over the post. He was the youngest prime minister in Dutch history; he had turned 43 only six months earlier. Major aspects of his time in office included extensive cutbacks in public spending, the launch of far-reaching deregulation and privatisation programs, and a massive demonstration in The Hague (1983) against the planned installation in the Netherlands of nuclear-armed U.S. cruise missiles (which was cancelled after all due to arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union).\nAfter leaving office in 1994, Lubbers was put forward as a candidate for the head of NATO, but the U.S. vetoed his appointment. He was on the advisory board of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), where he was regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system.\nLubbers was regarded by many during his time in office as an ideological heir to Margaret Thatcher.

The fruit bodies, which grow to a height of 1\u201318\u00a0cm (0.4\u20137.1\u00a0in), consist of up to a dozen cup-shaped (spathulate) to kidney-shaped (reniform) caps arranged in multiple tiers and attached to a central stem. Caps are joined to the main axis by short, flattened, stem-like attachments. The variety tristis, in contrast, has  caps that are more circular and appear to be pierced either centrally or off to the side. The surface of the caps is smooth and often brightly colored. The hymenium (spore-bearing surface) on the underside of the caps is pink and has a folded and corrugated surface. Close to the area of attachment between the cap and the stem-like connection to the main axis are swellings resembling warts or blisters. Individual caps resemble somewhat those of the European species Plicaturopsis crispa.\nPodoserpula has a monomitic hyphal structure, meaning that it only contains generative hyphae, which are  relatively undifferentiated and can develop reproductive structures. These hyphae are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), branched, and up to 10\u00a0\u03bcm thick. They have distinct, often swollen, clamp connections at the septa. The spores are small, typically 2.75\u20136 by 2\u20133.5\u00a0\u03bcm, smooth, hyaline, and vary in shape from roughly elliptical to somewhat spherical. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) can be either two- or four-spored, and are club shaped, with a clamp connection at the base. Podoserpula has neither cystidia nor gloeocystidia.\nPodoserpula pusio var. pusio is the nominate variety. Its fruit bodies are rarely greater than 7.5\u00a0cm (3.0\u00a0in) tall. Variety austro-americana is the largest of the varieties, reaching heights up to 18\u00a0cm (7.1\u00a0in). Other than its size and geographical distribution, it is roughly similar to var. pusio. Variety ellipsospora has elongated elliptical spores typically measuring 4\u20135 by 2.75\u20133.5\u00a0\u03bcm. Variety tristis has caps whose upper surfaces are colored pale fawn, and the main axis of the fruit bodies pierces through the cap.\nPodoserpula miranda grows to a height of 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).

He became their third summer signing and followed the footsteps of former Cork City teammate Roy O'Donovan by moving to the Stadium of Light. However, it was not until a year and a half after joining Sunderland that Meyler made his first professional appearance for the club, starting against Blackburn Rovers on 28 December 2009. In his third appearance for Sunderland, at Portsmouth on 9 February 2010, Meyler received a straight red card just minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute. He suffered serious cruciate ligament damage against Manchester United on 2 May 2010, that was feared would leave him sidelined for as long as 12 months.\nHowever, he made a quicker recovery than expected, making his comeback for Sunderland's Reserves against Liverpool Reserves, on 2 November 2010. Manager Steve Bruce insisted Meyler would not be rushed back to first team action. Surprisingly, he returned in an away match at Fulham, featuring for 52 minutes in a 0\u20130 draw. On 5 January 2011, Meyler pulled up suddenly and was stretchered off in Sunderland's away match at Aston Villa. It was revealed after the game by Bruce that Meyler suffered cruciate ligament damage to the same knee as before. It was later announced by Sunderland that Meyler had a scan on the knee and had torn his medial ligament. This ruled Meyler out for another 10 weeks at least rather than 6 months which was first feared. Meyler returned to the Sunderland bench for their defeat at Birmingham City on 16 April 2011.\nMeyler continued to be eased back to fitness by Sunderland in the 2011\u201312 season, playing in several reserve fixtures before making a cameo substitute appearance in the 2\u20132 draw with West Bromwich Albion on 1 October 2011. He also came on as a late substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester United. Meyler's first appearance under Martin O'Neill came as a 63rd-minute substitute in the 4\u20131 win at Wigan Athletic on 3 January 2012. Meyler made his first start of the season at Stoke City on 4 February, and was involved in controversy when Robert Huth received a straight red card for a challenge on him. Sunderland went on to win 1\u20130, and Stoke manager Tony Pulis was unhappy with Meyler's reaction: \"I think Robert commits himself them pulls out, and I don't think he actually touches Meyler, or whatever his name is, and I'm really disappointed at the player's reaction... I don't think Robert actually touches the lad, and the way he goes down and rolls around, for me he's done it for one reason and that was to get him sent off.\" Meyler did not start another game for the rest of the season, although he frequently appeared as a substitute.", "Imperial College London (legally Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine) is a public research university in London.

In 1990, Bush appointed a largely unknown state appellate judge, David Souter, to replace liberal icon William Brennan. Souter was easily confirmed and served until 2009, but joined the liberal bloc of the court, disappointing Bush. In 1991, Bush nominated conservative federal judge Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall, a long-time liberal stalwart. Thomas, the former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), faced heavy opposition in the Senate, as well as from pro-choice groups and the NAACP. His nomination faced another difficulty when Anita Hill accused Thomas of having sexually harassed her during his time as the chair of EEOC. Thomas won confirmation in a narrow 52\u201348 vote; 43 Republicans and 9 Democrats voted to confirm Thomas's nomination, while 46 Democrats and 2 Republicans voted against confirmation. Thomas became one of the most conservative justices of his era. In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 42 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 148 judges to the United States district courts.

The son of an Irish-American mother and a Civil War veteran father, he was raised in the Lower East Side of Manhattan near the Brooklyn Bridge, where he resided for his entire life. Like many other New York politicians of his era, he was also linked to the notorious Tammany Hall political machine that controlled New York City's politics, although he remained personally untarnished by corruption. Smith was a strong opponent of Prohibition. He was also the first Catholic to be nominated by a major party. His candidacy mobilized Catholic votes, especially from women, who had only recently received federal suffrage. It also brought out the anti-Catholic vote, which was especially strong among white conservative Democrats in the South, although Smith was still successful within the states of the Deep South.\nAs a committed \"wet\" who opposed the prohibition laws, Smith attracted two groups: those who wanted their beer, wine and liquor and did not like dealing with criminal bootleggers, and those who were outraged that new criminal gangs had taken over the streets in most large and medium-sized cities. Many Protestants feared his candidacy, including German Lutherans and Southern Baptists, believing that the Pope in Rome would dictate his policies. Incumbent Republican Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover was greatly aided by national prosperity and the absence of American involvement in war; Smith lost in a landslide to him, losing six southern states but carrying the Deep South. Four years later, Smith sought the 1932 nomination but was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt, his former ally and successor as Governor of New York. Smith entered business in New York City, became involved in the construction and promotion of the Empire State Building, and became an increasingly vocal opponent of Roosevelt's New Deal.", "Below are some examples of nsibidi recorded by J.

Several songs on the album have no song structure at all, an example being \"Nocturne,\" an eerie, atmospheric song. Sarah Meador of Rambles has nonetheless conceded that \"always there is poetry, and some interaction of voice and music that carries a piece beyond spoken word.\" The music on the album is said to be \"haunting rather than catchy\" and each track is said to work cohesively within the album \"like movements in a suite.\" One critic described the music on the album as \"art folk.\"\nEighteen musical instruments were used on Afterplanesman, mostly played by Pynn but several by collaborator Tom Arnold. Indeed, Musician magazine noted: \"There are certainly surprises in store: violins, poetry, acoustic guitar and playing card sound effects on the surreal 'Joker Jack'.\" The Sunday Times noted the album's usage of self made instruments and sampled vocals which \"range across cultural, geographical and temporal boundaries.\" Pynn himself plays the acoustic and electric guitar, 10-string bouzouki, lap dulcimer, wine glasses, ode, violin, mandocello, theremin, mandolin and pedalboard on the album. \n\"Heriot Row\" works its way through minor and diminished chords before reaching \"a happy-sounding conclusion.\" The eerie \"Nocturne\" makes use of only a theremin and vocals.", "Agonum emarginatum is a species of ground beetle from Platyninae subfamily, that can be found in all European countries except for Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, Portugal, and Vatican City.", "Nickel bis(dimethylglyoximate) is the coordination complex with the formula Ni[ONC(CH\u2083)C(CH\u2083)NOH]\u2082.

Some scientists suggest that several tens of plumes exist, whereas others suggest that there are none. The theory was really inspired by the Hawaiian volcano system. Hawaii is a large volcanic edifice in the center of the Pacific Ocean, far from any plate boundaries. Its regular, time-progressive chain of islands and seamounts superficially fits the plume theory well. However, it is almost unique on Earth, as nothing as extreme exists anywhere else. The second strongest candidate for a plume location is often quoted to be Iceland, but according to opponents of the plume hypothesis its massive nature can be explained by plate tectonic forces along the mid-Atlantic spreading center.\nMantle plumes have been suggested as the source for flood basalts. These extremely rapid, large scale eruptions of basaltic magmas have periodically formed continental flood basalt provinces on land and oceanic plateaus in the ocean basins, such as the Deccan Traps, the Siberian Traps the Karoo-Ferrar flood basalts of Gondwana, and the largest known continental flood basalt, the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP).\nMany continental flood basalt events coincide with continental rifting.

Burnt areas usually have better quality and accessibility of foods for animals, which attract animals to forage from nearby habitats. For example, fires can kill trees and dead trees can attract insects. Birds are attracted by the abundance of food and they can spread the seeds of herbaceous plants. Eventually large herbivores will also flourish. Also, large mammals prefer newly burnt areas because they need less vigilance for predators. An example of animals' uses on fires is the black kite, a carnivorous bird which can be found globally. Although it is still not confirmed, black kites were witnessed to carry smoldering sticks to deliberately start fires. These birds can then capture the escaping insects and rodents.", "Makovce is a village and municipality in Stropkov District in the Pre\u0161ov Region of north-eastern Slovakia.", "In 2011, 650 WPV cases were reported in sixteen countries: the four endemic countries\u2014Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria and India\u2014as well as twelve others. Polio transmission recurred in Angola, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kenya reported its first case since 2009, while China reported 21 cases, mostly among the Uyghurs of Hotan prefecture, Xinjiang, the first cases since 1994.\nThe total number of wild-virus cases reported in 2012 was 223, lower than any previous year. These were limited to five countries\u2014Nigeria, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chad, and Niger\u2014of which all except Nigeria had fewer cases than in 2011. Several additional countries, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Yemen, saw outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived polio. The last reported type\u00a03 case of polio worldwide had its onset 11 November 2012 in Nigeria; the last wild case outside Nigeria was in April 2012 in Pakistan, and its absence from sewage monitoring in Pakistan suggests that active transmission of this strain has ceased there.  A total of 416 wild-virus cases were reported in 2013, almost double the previous year. Of these, cases in endemic countries dropped from 197 to 160, while those in non-endemic countries jumped from 5 to 256 owing to two outbreaks: one in the Horn of Africa, and one in Syria.\nIn April, a case of wild polio in Mogadishu was reported, the first in Somalia since 2007. By October, over 170 cases had been reported in the country, with more cases in neighboring Kenya and the Somali Region of Ethiopia.\nRoutine sewage monitoring in 2012 had detected a WPV1 strain of Pakistani origin in Cairo, sparking a major vaccination push there. The strain spread to Israel, where there was widespread environmental detection, but like Egypt, no paralysis cases. It had more severe consequences when it spread to neighboring Syria, with the total number of cases eventually reaching 35, the first outbreak there since 1999.\nIn April 2013, the WHO announced a new $5.5\u00a0billion, 6-year cooperative plan (called the 2013\u201318 Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan) to eradicate polio from its last reservoirs. The plan called for mass immunization campaigns in the three remaining endemic countries, and also dictated a switch to inactivated virus injections, to avoid the risk of the vaccine-derived outbreaks that occasionally occur from use of the live-virus oral vaccine.\n\nIn 2014, there were 359 reported cases of wild poliomyelitis, spread over twelve countries. Pakistan had the most with 306, an increase from 93 in 2013, which was blamed on Al Qaeda and Taliban militants preventing aid workers from vaccinating children in rural regions of the country.  On 27 March 2014, the WHO announced the eradication of poliomyelitis in the South-East Asia Region, in which the WHO includes eleven countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, North Korea, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. With the addition of this region, the proportion of world population living in polio-free regions reached 80%. The last case of wild polio in the South-East Asia Region was reported in India on 13 January 2011.\nDuring 2015, 74 cases of wild poliomyelitis were reported worldwide, 54 in Pakistan and 20 in Afghanistan. There were 32 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases in 2015.\nOn 25 September 2015, the WHO declared that Nigeria was no longer considered endemic for wild polio virus, with no reported case of wild polio virus having been reported since 24 July 2014.  A WPV1 strain not seen in five years resurfaced in Nigeria the following year.\nThe WPV2 virus was declared eradicated in September 2015 as it had not been detected in circulation since 1999 and WPV3 was declared eradicated in October 2019, having last been detected in 2012. Both types persist in the form of circulating vaccine-derived strains, the product of years-long evolution of transmissible oral vaccine in under-immunized populations.", "In recent decades, Middletown has focused on balancing the needs and comforts of its residents with the commercial development required to help fund services. These efforts date at least from 1931, when the city was one of the first in America to establish a planning board. Progress continued under the leadership of Democratic mayor, Domenique S. Thornton, who served a record eight years (four terms) as mayor. The city attracted a 12-screen movie theater and numerous restaurants and other businesses to the downtown area, the city provided free wi-fi service along Main Street and the historic Inn at Middletown a luxury four and half star boutique hotel transformed the former vacant National Guard Armory. On November 8, 2005, Republican Sebastian Giuliano won the mayor's office, replacing Thornton, whom he criticized for raising taxes and for the awarding of a contract for the construction of a new high school to Tomasso Brothers, Inc., a firm that had been the target of a federal corruption probe. During Giuliano's three terms in office, Middletown's Main Street became a hub for small businesses, and the city began investing heavily in the arts. Democrat Daniel T. Drew defeated Giuliano in 2011. Drew has pushed for increased development in the city's North End, an area that has been plagued by poverty and crime in recent decades. In November 2012, voters approved a $37 Million initiative to move Middletown's wastewater to the Mattabassett Sewer District treatment plant in nearby Cromwell. Previously, the city had operated its own sewage treatment plant on the banks of the Connecticut River. The city has made plans to tear down this older plant and develop the riverfront property on which it sits. Middletown continues to support manufacturing and small business.\nMiddletown has remained an important government administrative center. From the creation of Middlesex County in 1798 until the elimination of county government in 1965 Middletown was the county seat. Middletown today retains Middlesex Superior Court, and the Judicial District remains that of the former county court. Other county functions were either centralized to the state or transferred to the towns. The former county building has been removed, but there are other state agency buildings elsewhere in the city, such as the Dept. of Social Services on Main Street Ext. Middletown's Probate Court district includes the towns of Cromwell, Portland, Middlefield and Haddam. The city is also the site of the controversial State Juvenile Training Center.\nCulturally and politically, Middletown is in the midst of an effort to revitalize its historically disadvantaged North End. Economic development projects recently completed in the North End include Wharfside Commons, a 96-unit mixed income apartment block, and the new Community Health Center (completed in 2012 at the corner of Main and Grand Streets). The Green Street Arts Center, founded by Wesleyan and a coalition of community groups in 2000, is a pioneering attempt to attract residents and businesses to the neighborhood by promoting arts education and outreach. For decades, the famous O'Rourke's Diner has done much to bring some stability to the North End. A fire on August 31, 2006, gutted much of the historic structure. The Middletown community held many fundraising events to raise money for the diner's rebuilding. Reconstruction began in September 2007, and O'Rourke's Diner re-opened in February 2008. Mayor Daniel Drew (2011-2019) supported citizen-oriented efforts to revitalize the North End, such as the local nonprofit NEAT (North End Action Team). In 2012, the City of Middletown and NEAT partnered to form the \"I Heart the North End\" initiative, which plans to raise public awareness of the economic and cultural opportunities available in the area.\nMiddletown is the only location of a well-known youth theater group, Oddfellows Playhouse, which is located on Washington Street and pulls in children of all ages from all over the state to learn theater skills.

Ashridge House served the Egerton family as a residence until the 19th century. The Egertons later had a family chapel (the Bridgewater Chapel) with burial vault in Little Gaddesden Church, where many monuments commemorate the Dukes and Earls of Bridgewater and their families.", "Gladstone in 1870 had sponsored an Order in Council, introducing competitive examination into the Civil Service, diminishing the political aspects of government hiring. Disraeli did not agree, and while he did not seek to reverse the order, his actions often frustrated its intent. For example, Disraeli made political appointments to positions previously given to career civil servants. In this, he was backed by his party, hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government. Disraeli gave positions to hard-up Conservative leaders, even\u2014to Gladstone's outrage\u2014creating one office at \u00a32,000 per year. Nevertheless, Disraeli made fewer peers (only 22, and one of those one of Victoria's sons) than had Gladstone\u2014the Liberal leader had arranged for the bestowal of 37 peerages during his just over five years in office.\nAs he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making Sydney Turner, son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, Dean of Ripon. He favoured Low church clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons. In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, Albert, Prince Consort, preferred Broad church teachings. One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the 1868 election. When the position of Archbishop of Canterbury fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, Archibald Tait, the Bishop of London. To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint Samuel Wilberforce, the former Bishop of Winchester and leading figure in London society. Disraeli disliked Wilberforce and instead appointed John Jackson, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him.", "Bill Hager (born February 6, 1947) is a Republican politician from Florida.

Field was a pupil of dockyard engineer Simon Goodrich from 1803 to 1805. \nCommissioned by Samuel Bentham, the Inspector-general of naval works, he worked with Samuel Goodrich to develop tools for mass-producing ships' blocks at Portsmouth Dockyard. The block mills they designed required ten unskilled men to take the place of 110 skilled craftsmen, and have been recognised as the first use of machine tools for mass production. \nThey were built by Henry Maudslay between 1802 and 1806, and represented the first steam-powered manufactory in any dockyard.\nHe then joined Maudslay to form the firm of Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field of Lambeth. One of their projects was to build engines for the SS Great Western's Atlantic crossing of 1838.\nHe was a prolific engineer working with the Atlantic Telegraph Company on machinery for cable laying, the Metropolitan Board of Works on sewage systems and Isambard Kingdom Brunel on his steamships.\nField joined seven other young engineers who, in 1817, decided to found the Institution of Civil Engineers as a more accessible institution than the established but \u00e9litist Society of Civil Engineers founded by John Smeaton in 1771. \nHe served as their vice-president in 1837, and he continued to hold that office until elected president on 18 January 1848, being the first mechanical engineer to hold the presidency and the only one of the original proposers to hold the post. In his inaugural address, delivered on 1 February, he alluded particularly to the changes which had then been introduced into steam navigation which allowed for a greater capacity and speeds. On 3 March 1836 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and was also a member of the Society of Arts.\nField died at his residence, Balham Hill House, Surrey, on 11 August 1863, aged 76 and was interred at West Norwood Cemetery in a Portland stone sarcophagus.", "On July 22, 1620 (Old Style date), the initial group of English Dissenters living in Leiden boarded the Speedwell, which was meant to accompany another ship to be hired in England. This initial group included the mostly Brownist congregation. Myles and Rose Standish were aboard, along with the Bradfords, Winslows, Carvers, and others. The small, 60-ton pinnace sailed to Southampton with about 30 passengers, to be provisioned and join a much larger vessel for the voyage to the New World. Another 90 passengers would board the 180-ton Mayflower. The Speedwell had some significant leaks while in port that caused delays, but both vessels departed Southampton on August 5.\nThe leaders of the colony decided to leave the smaller Speedwell behind after numerous delays caused by leaking, which had caused them to return to port twice. The Standishes and most of the Speedwell passengers crowded into the Mayflower, and the Speedwell went on to London to be resold, now with only a few passengers. (She subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners, but never sailed to the New World.) The Mayflower passengers, meanwhile, sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees, and finally departed Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620, bound for the northern part of the Virginia Colony.\nThe passage of the Mayflower across the Atlantic lasted more than two months, with 102 passengers crowded onto the cargo ship's gun deck and about 30 crew members. The seas were not severe during the first month of the voyage but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. One passenger died at sea, and four others died while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod.\nOn November 9, 1620, lookouts spotted land, but they discovered that they were near Cape Cod and about 200 miles east-northeast of their planned destination of northern Virginia. They tried briefly to sail south, but strong seas forced them to retreat to Cape Cod to harbor near the hook of Provincetown Harbor. It became apparent that the weather would not permit the passage south, so they decided to settle near Cape Cod. Shortage of supplies (including wood and beer) and the roaring Atlantic made it too dangerous to press on for a Virginia landing. They anchored at the hook on November 11, and the leaders of the colony wrote the Mayflower Compact to ensure a degree of law and order in this place where they had not been granted a patent to settle. Myles Standish was one of the 41 men who signed it.", "Princess Madeleine did not adopt the surname O'Neill and instead remained without a surname, allowing her to retain the style of Royal Highness.

Students tend to choose the cheaper options and with a fare price increase in 2015 that doubled the original price, no wonder students chose other means of transportation than the Rapid KL.\nIncreased rail capacity: Prasarana issued tenders for the purchase of new LRT and monorail rolling stock to increase carrying capacity, including 35 new train sets for the Kelana Jaya Line in October 2006 and October 2007. The trains were expected to be operational by September 2009. On 27 July 2009, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the 35 new four-car trains would be operational by end-2012.\nExpanded bus fleet: As most of the Rapid KL buses inherited were old and poorly maintained, the immediate concern was to get more buses on the road. In 2005, the government promised 200 new Rapid KL buses.\nIncreased bus routes: Prasarana introduced several new routes to cover previously unserved areas.\nScheduled bus services: Rapid Bus introduced scheduled services for 16 Rapid KL bus routes which were not heavily utilised. For the first time in Malaysia, expected bus arrival times and timetables were posted at bus stops along routes. However, the bus stop timetables as well as the myrapid website has since been removed due to the inability of services to reliably adhere to these schedules. This was primarily caused by problems such as traffic congestion and an insufficient number of serviceable buses.\nCommon monthly passes for both the rail and bus networks: For the first time commuters were offered monthly passes which could be used on both rail and bus networks, helping to enhance the integration of the public transport system.\nCommon signage for all Prasarana owned rail lines: The renaming of the PUTRA LRT and STAR LRT, lines along with the changing of the signage in the LRT and monorail stations helped to enhance the integration of the previously unconnected systems.\nCommon Ticketing Systems: All rail lines under Rapid KL which previously functioned as separate systems were integrated with a new and single common ticketing system since 2011, allowing seamless transfer between the various rail lines. The stored-value Touch 'n Go could be used on all Rapid KL buses and rail lines as well.\nRevamp of the bus network: Prasarana scrapped the old Intrakota and Cityliner routes it inherited and introduced three types of bus services: City shuttles (BANDAR), trunk buses (UTAMA), local shuttles (TEMPATAN) and express buses (EKSPRES). City shuttles operate within Kuala Lumpur's central business district while trunk buses link hubs at the edge of the CBD with suburban transportation hubs.

Temperatures within a given winter can ghange a lot also. Long cold snaps can be followed by sudden warmth with temperatures above freezing. this is because of changes in the wind.\nSummers can be warm and dry for a long time. This can make it easy for wildfires to start. Weak thunderstorms can produce lightning that starts a fire. These fires are often left to burn if they are far away from where people live. The 2004 season had the most fires. Over 6,600,000 acres (27,000\u00a0km\u00b2) were burned.\nThe average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 11.3\u00a0inches (28.7\u00a0cm). Most of this is snow during the winter. Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the Gulf of Alaska. Most of these storms are blocked or weakened by passing over the mountains.\nThe months from May to July in the summer have no darkness at night. They only have a twilight during the night hours. The months of November to January are the other way around. They have little daylight. It is light for about 21 hours every day between May 10 and August 2. It is light less than four hours each day between November 18 and January 24. On clear winter nights, the aurora borealis, or \"Northern lights\" can often be seen dancing in the sky. A lot of the ground in the Interior has permafrost, meaning that there is a layer of soil that is always frozen.", "The Boston Store is located between 7th and 8th Streets on State Street in downtown Erie. The six-story tall, buff brick building is predominantly cubical with a frontage of 145 feet (44\u00a0m) along State Street. The facade is divided into eight bays by brick piers.; the bays are further subdivided by secondary piers. The top of the building is capped with parapet, with piers extending above it and topped with stone coping. Vertical panels containing blue and tan terracotta are inset in the parapets of each bay. The bay containing the main entrance is off-centered and wider than the others; instead of a parapet, it is capped with a balcony-like structure inlaid with terracotta.\nThe \"signature exterior feature of the Boston Store\" is the four sided,  40-foot (10\u00a0m) bell and clock tower situated over the main entrance. It is supported by four tiers of buttresses, each decreasing in size and capped with beveled limestone. The design of the clock tower \"recalls religious, civic, and collegiate themes, and became an instant landmark on the Erie skyline.\" Each of the four clock faces are 12 feet (4\u00a0m) in diameter and have \"black metal Roman numerals [on] a background of white translucent glass panels\". Terra-cotta circles are inlaid across the top of the tower and \"above the last step of the buttresses\". The lower section of the tower houses the bell behind a geometric tracery.\nA hallway running from State Street to Peach Street entrances bisects the Boston Store. A cube-shaped, four-sided clock built by International Business Machines hangs in the hallway.\nLettering on the marquees denote the building as the BOSTON STORE and ERIE DRY GOODS CO. For a short time in early 2011, the signs were replaced with ones for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, before public sentiment forced the switch back.

During a rough stretch of the season the Panthers continued to make changes to their offensive line lineup, hoping to hit on a group that would gel. When injuries struck prior to the Week 13 Minnesota Vikings game, Remmers got his shot.  With the newly installed Remmers at right tackle and Andrew Norwell at left guard, the O-line finally hit a groove.  Though the game was a close loss, the coaching staff liked the lineup and Remmers remained a starter for the remainder of the season.\nDuring the 2015 NFL Draft, the Panthers selected offensive tackle Daryl Williams out of Oklahoma in the fourth round.  Williams and Remmers would compete for the right tackle spot during training camp, with Remmers ultimately winning out.  Remmers would go on to start at right tackle for the rest of the season as the Panthers went 17-1 in both the regular season and playoffs and made it to Super Bowl 50 against the Denver Broncos. Remmers had the worst professional game of his career in the Super Bowl as he was primarily matched up against the eventual game MVP Von Miller, allowing multiple pressures and two sacks, both of which led to fumbles recovered by Denver.\nDuring training camp for the 2016 season, Remmers again competed with Daryl Williams for a starting position.  Once more, Remmers won and entered the season as the Panthers' starting right tackle.  However, in Week 4, against the Atlanta Falcons, with fellow tackle Michael Oher unable to play because of a concussion, Remmers drew the start as the Panther's left tackle.  He would wind up remaining the Panther's starting left tackle throughout the remainder of the season, as Oher never returned from his concussion.", "Maxi Gnauck (born 10 October 1964) is a retired artistic gymnast who represented East Germany. With a total of 27 medals at the Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cups, and European Championships she is considered one of the most successful woman gymnasts that Germany has ever produced. In 1980 she was selected East German Sportspersonality of the Year.\nHer parents were expecting a boy and they planned to name him Max so, when the baby turned out to be a girl, they simply added an 'i', creating an uncommon name for Germany. When Maxi was five, her mother took her to a gymnastics centre in their area.  By age eight, Maxi had won her first medals at the Kreisspartakiade. When she was nine she changed her club to SC Dynamo Berlin, where she was coached by Jurgen Heritz. Considered one of the best uneven bars competitors of all time, Maxi was also an excellent tumbler.  She was one of the first female gymnasts to perform a triple twist on floor.\nIn April 1986, Maxi officially announced her retirement and began a four-year course in sports coaching at the University of Leipzig. In 1988 she was severely injured while sliding down a waterslide while working as an aide at a children's summer camp by the Baltic Sea. She broke her C5 vertebra and was nearly paralysed. Three vertebrae were later reinforced with a metal plate.\nFacing a strong competition after the reunification of East Germany and West Germany, she first took temporary coaching positions in South Africa and Great Britain, both for a few months in 1990.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.\nShields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family's coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, a la jineta (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey's seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, a la brida, a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.\nAround the 14th and 15th centuries heavy cavalry gained a predominant role, where knights used to wear full plate armors.", "The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the \"immortal oil of the rose\" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him \"among rose blossoms\". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The color of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.\n Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht D\u00fcrer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.\nRoses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.\nRoses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.\nHenri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.\nOther impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul C\u00e9zanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works.\nIn 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.", "Chen Longhai  (born 29 March 1991) is a Chinese male volleyball player.

Hallmark Cards began construction of Crown Center.  The city also built the Bartle Hall convention center.  Architect Helmut Jahn's first major work was the revolutionary design for Kemper Arena, which had no columns blocking sight lines and was built in 18 months in time to attract the 1976 Republican National Convention.\nThe optimism of this era came to a crashing end when the Kemper Arena roof collapsed during a storm in 1979 (although no one was injured) and when skybridges at the new Hyatt Regency in Crown Center collapsed in the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse on July 17, 1981 in the worst engineering disaster in recorded history in terms of human lives.  Both buildings were  repaired and remain in use.\nIn addition to these disasters, TWA asked the city to extensively rebuild the terminals at the newly opened Kansas City International Airport so that it could have central checkpoints.  The airport renovations had already come in at $100 million over budget, so the city refused.  As a result, TWA moved its hub to St. Louis.  In 2006, the city finally announced plans for a $250 million overhaul of the terminals to accommodate the security issues.\nIn the 1980s, the nation moved from the \"modern\" style of architecture (as inspired by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe), building large, boxy structures, to a \"postmodern\" style.

A dietary supplement can supply vitamin D without this mutagenic effect. Vitamin D has been suggested as having a wide range of positive health effects, which include strengthening bones and possibly inhibiting the growth of some cancers. UV exposure also has positive effects for endorphin levels, and possibly for protection against multiple sclerosis. Visible sunlight to the eyes gives health benefits through its association with the timing of melatonin synthesis, maintenance of normal and robust circadian rhythms, and reduced risk of seasonal affective disorder.\nLong-term sunlight exposure is known to be associated with the development of some types of skin cancer, skin aging, immune suppression, and eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration.  Conversely, sun avoidance is associated with increased mortality.\nSince UV rays, and therefore sunlight and sunlamps, are carcinogens that also have health benefits, a number of public health organizations state that there needs to be a balance between the risks of having too much sunlight or too little. There is a general consensus that sunburn should always be avoided.", "Hassan Abya (1962) is a cabinet member in the Moroccan government under Saad Eddine El Othmani.

The Army built the fort shortly after its rout at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in late July 1861. The Army named the fort after General Israel B. Richardson, whose division had been deployed to defend the City of Washington against attack by way of the Columbia Turnpike.\nThe structure, which was the highest fortification on the Arlington Line, occupied a commanding position on the crest of a ridge. It had a perimeter of 316 yards and emplacements for 15 guns, including a 100-pound Parrott rifle that could sweep a sector from Fort Ellsworth to Fort DeKalb (later named Fort Strong). The fort housed bomb-proofs and two ammunition magazines, and was adjacent to a military encampment. \n\nA May 17, 1864, report from the Union Army's Inspector of Artillery (see Union Army artillery organization) noted the following: \nFort Richardson, Major Trumbull commanding.\u2013Garrison, three companies First Connecticut Heavy Artillery\u20131 major, 12 commissioned officers, 1 ordnance-sergeant, 412 men.

Magazines, two: dry and in good order. Ammunition, full supply and serviceable. Implements, complete and in good order. Drill in artillery, fair. Drill in infantry, fair. Discipline, fair. Garrison sufficient for the work.\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, the United States Army returned many of the properties that contained its fortifications in the Washington, D.C., area to the properties' rightful owners. In some instances, the Army compensated the owners for the use of the properties and for damages that had resulted from the Army's wartime activities.  In addition, the Army sold at auction many of the fortifications' materials.\nThe remnants of Fort Richardson are presently located on the grounds of the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington County, Virginia. The fortification's earthen south wall and ditches are well-preserved. A historic marker that the Arlington County government erected in 1965 stands along the Country Club's private access road (Memorial Drive) alongside the remnants of the fort.", "Polesworth is a large village and civil parish in the North Warwickshire district of Warwickshire, England.

If the Stift as a fund served to maintain the specific college of a cathedral (a so-called cathedral chapter) then the Stift was often called das Domstift (i.e. cathedral donation [fund]). \nHochstift is a compound with hoch (\"high\") used for a prince-bishopric, meaning literally a \"high [ranking ecclesiastical] donation [fund of estates]\". Whereas Erzstift, a compound with Erz\u2026 (\"arch[i]\u2026\"), was the corresponding expression for a prince-archbishopric. For the three prince-electorates of Cologne (Kurk\u00f6ln), Mainz (Kurmainz) and Trier (Kurtrier), which were simultaneously archbishoprics the corresponding term is Kurerzstift (electorate-archbishopric). The adjective pertaining to Stift as a territory is stiftisch (of, pertaining to a prince-bishopric; prince-episcopal). As a compound, the term Stift today usually takes the copulative \"s\" when used as a preceding compound, such as in Stiftsadel (vassal nobility of a prince-bishopric), Stiftsamtmann (=official of a Stift), Stiftsmann (plural: Stiftsleute; =vassal tenant of an estate of a Stift), Stiftssasse (=subject/inhabitant of a prince-bishopric), Stiftsst\u00e4nde (=estates of a prince-bishopric as a realm), or Stiftstag (diet of the estates of a prince-bishopric). \nSpecific prince-bishoprics were often called Hochstift/Erzstift X, as in Hochstift Ermland or in Erzstift Bremen, with stiftbremisch meaning of/pertaining to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, as opposed to stadtbremisch (of/pertaining to the city of Bremen). By contrast, the spiritual entities, the dioceses, are called Bistum (\"diocese\") or Erzbistum (\"archdiocese\") in German. The difference between a Hochstift/Erzstift and a Bistum/Erzbistum is not always clear to authors so that non-scholarly texts often translate Hochstift or Erzstift incorrectly simply as diocese/bishopric or archdiocese/archbishopric, respectively.", "On 25 March 1951, Argentine President Juan Per\u00f3n announced that a former German scientist, Ronald Richter, had succeeded in producing fusion at a laboratory scale as part of what is now known as the Huemul Project. Scientists around the world were excited by the announcement, but soon concluded it was not true; simple calculations showed that his experimental setup could not produce enough energy to heat the fusion fuel to the needed temperatures.\nAlthough dismissed by nuclear researchers, the widespread news coverage meant politicians were suddenly aware of, and receptive to, fusion research. In the UK, Thomson, who had been repeatedly refused, was suddenly granted considerable funding. Over the next months, two projects based on the pinch system were up and running. In the US, Lyman Spitzer read the Huemul story, realized it was false, and set about designing a machine that would work. In May he was awarded $50,000 to begin research on his stellarator concept. Jim Tuck had returned to the UK briefly and saw Thomson's pinch machines. When he returned to Los Alamos he also applied for funding at the same time as Spitzer, but was turned down. Instead, he was given a matching $50,000 directly from the Los Alamos budget.\nSimilar events occurred in the USSR. In mid-April, Dmitri Efremov of the Scientific Research Institute of Electrophysical Apparatus stormed into Kurchatov's study with a magazine containing a story about Richter's work, demanding to know why they were beaten by the Argentines. Kurchatov immediately contacted Beria with a proposal to set up a separate fusion research laboratory with Lev Artsimovich as director. Only days later, on 5 May, the proposal had been signed by Joseph Stalin.", "During the Afghan Civil War (1992-96), the Soviet House of Science and Culture in west Kabul was destroyed during fighting between rival factions.\nIn 1993, Tajik rebels based in Afghanistan attacked a Russian border outpost in Tajikistan amid the Tajikistani Civil War, killing 25 Russians and prompting Russian retaliatory strikes, which caused extensive damage in northern Afghanistan. Reports of Afghan support for the rebels, part of the United Tajik Opposition against the Dushanbe government, led to cool relations between Russia and Afghanistan.\nRussia became increasingly disenchanted with the Taliban over their support for Chechen rebels and for providing a sanctuary for terrorist groups active in Central Asia and in Russia itself. Russia provided military assistance to the Afghan Northern Alliance, who eventually proved to be a major force in the efforts to overthrow the Taliban regime following United States intervention in 2001.\nIn October 2005, Russian defence officials stated they would be giving helicopters and other military equipment to Afghanistan's army worth $30 million USD.\nIn October 2010, Afghan President Hamid Karzai reprimanded Russia after its forces entered the country without permission. He also stated that Russia has \"violated Afghan sovereignty\" in a joint mission with United States agents.\nHowever, after Russia's relations with the West soured following the Ukraine conflict, Moscow decided to become active and expand its role in Afghanistan, according to Omar Nassar, the director of the Moscow-based Center for Contemporary Afghan Studies (CISA).\nIn an exclusive interview with Sputnik news agency, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said: \"Our two countries have very close ties now. Russia as a neighboring country, with which we have long historical ties and traditionally friendly relations, can contribute to the peace process, and we believe that friendship with Russia will become an important factor of stability and sustainable development of our country.\"\nRussia's more active involvement in Afghanistan includes business investment proposals, diplomatic propaganda, cultural programs, financial and military support for the central government, power influence in the north and with the Taliban. Since 2016, it has provided the Afghan government with tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition. Moscow has already launched several efforts at diplomacy. Between December 2016 and April 2017, Russia hosted three rounds of talks involving China, Iran, and Pakistan. In the third round, it included Afghanistan, as well.\nIn 2017, a new Russian cultural center was built and (re-)opened in Kabul's Darulaman Road, on the same site as the former Soviet-era House of Science and Culture which was built in 1982 and damaged by war in the 1990s.\nA ceremony was held in Moscow on 28 May 2019 marking the 100th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

The director opted to replace Gobrecht's soaring eagle reverse with a left-facing bald eagle based on a design by former Mint engraver John Reich, a design first used on silver and gold coinage in 1807.  Although the reverse for the dollar was probably selected to match that of the quarter and half dollar, it is not known why the flying eagle design was not used for the lower denominations in the first place.  Numismatic historian Walter Breen speculates that a Treasury official might have preferred the Reich design.\nThe obverse of the Gobrecht dollar was in high relief, but Mint officials felt that this should be lowered for the new coin, which was to be struck in much larger quantities.  Patterson hired Robert Ball Hughes, a Philadelphia artist, to modify the design. As part of Hughes' modifications, Liberty's head was enlarged, the drapery was thickened, and the relief was lowered overall.  Thirteen stars were also included on the obverse.  On the Gobrecht dollar, with its high relief, the depiction of Liberty appears like a statue on a plinth; the flatter Seated Liberty  decreased relief appears  more like an engraving.\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule tied the appearance of the obverse to neoclassicism, noting the resemblance of Gobrecht's Liberty to the marble statues of ancient Rome.  The neoclassical school was popular in the first half of the 19th century, and not only among official artists; Vermeule noted, \"it becomes almost painfully evident that similar sources were consulted both by the engravers of United States coins in Philadelphia and by the cutters of tombstones from Maine to Illinois\".  The reverse retained the shield upon the eagle's breast.  Art historian Vermeule described it as \"the same old unnatural, unartistic eagle with shield on his stomach, like a baseball umpire's protector\u00a0... to clutch branch and olives in one foot, arrows of war in the other oversized set of claws\".  According to numismatic historian David Lange, the Reich-Gobrecht reverse design is known among some coin collectors as the \"sandwich-board eagle\".  Breen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, complains of \"the 'improvements' inflicted by [Hughes] on a hapless Ms. Liberty.  Compared with the original Sully-Gobrecht conception of 1836\u201339, this is a sorry mess indeed.\"", "Varenye is an old Slavic word which is used in East Slavic languages in a more general sense to refer to any type of sweet fruit preserve.

Examples are the translations of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harry Potter, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and the animated movies about Karlsson-on-the-roof.\nThe same is true when translating from Russian.

Observations made by Mars Orbiter Camera in 2001 have shown that the scarps and pit walls of the south polar cap had retreated at an average rate of about 3 meters (10\u00a0feet) since 1999. In other words, they were retreating 3 meters per Mars year. In some places on the cap, the scarps retreat less than 3 meters a Mars year, and in others it can retreat as much as 8 meters (26\u00a0feet) per Martian year.  Over time, south polar pits merge to become plains, mesas turn into buttes, and buttes vanish forever. The round shape is probably aided in its formation by the angle of the sun.  In the summer, the sun moves around the sky, sometimes for 24 hours each day, just above the horizon.  As a result, the walls of a round depression will receive more intense sunlight than the floor; the wall will melt far more than the floor. The walls melt and recede, while the floor remains the same.\nLater research with the powerful HiRISE showed that the pits are in a 1-10 meter thick layer of dry ice that is sitting on a much larger water ice cap.  Pits have been observed to begin with small areas along faint fractures.  The circular pits have steep walls that work to focus sunlight, thereby increasing erosion.

Led by Sergio Osme\u00f1a, the assembly was held predominantly by the Nacionalista Party, which advocated independence; they were opposed by the Progresista Party, which advocated statehood within the United States. The Americans controlled the Philippine Commission, the upper house of the Philippine Legislature. The Nacionalista-dominated Philippine Assembly, and later the Philippine Senate, which was created by the Jones Law and replaced the Philippine Commission, was often at odds with the Governor-General. However, the Nacionalistas were split into camps loyal to Osme\u00f1a and Senate President Manuel L. Quezon. Several independence missions were sent to Washington, D.C.; the OsRox Mission led by Osme\u00f1a and House Speaker Manuel Roxas resulted in the Hare\u2013Hawes\u2013Cutting Act. However, the Senate rejected this; a new law, the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which was marginally different and more importantly, was supported by Quezon, was approved and paved the way for the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\nQuezon and Osme\u00f1a reconciled, and both were easily elected as president and vice president respectively, in 1935. The Nacionalistas controlled the now unicameral National Assembly for the entirety of the Commonwealth, with the understanding that the Americans would grant independence in the near future. Quezon pressed for constitutional amendments that would allow him to obtain a second term and the restoration of a bicameral legislature. Quezon did obtain both amendments, with the newly restored Senate now being elected at-large instead of per districts, as what was done during the pre-Commonwealth era. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a and the Nacionalista Party as a whole both won the elections in 1941 in much larger margins.\nThe Japanese invasion of 1941 at the onset of World War II delayed this granting of independence, forced the Commonwealth government to go into exile, and subjected the country to a puppet government. The KALIBAPI became the sole legal political party, and Jose P. Laurel was declared president of the Second Philippine Republic. This nationalist KALIBAPI government espoused anti-American sentiment. Exiled leaders of the previous first Commonwealth government, including Quezon and Osme\u00f1a, provided limited support to the U.S. Despite the relationship with Japanese officials and opposition to U.S. control, the nationalist KALIBAPI government of Laurel refused to declare war on the U.S. However, the Americans reconquered the country in 1944, and Osme\u00f1a, who had succeeded Quezon upon the latter's death, restored the Commonwealth government. The first meeting of a bicameral Commonwealth Congress occurred.\nThe Nacionalistas were divided during the 1946 presidential election, with Manuel Roxas setting up what would later be the Liberal Party. Roxas defeated Osme\u00f1a, and became the last president of the Commonwealth; the Americans agreed to grant independence on July 4, 1946.", "The Blood Order (German: Blutorden), officially known as the Decoration in Memory (of the Munich putsch) of 9 November 1923 (German: Medaille zur Erinnerung an den 9.

In 1927, the Commercial Aviation Company commenced weekly Adelaide-Mount Gambier services, using Airco D.H.9 G-AUHT.\nDuring late 1927, the MacRobertson-Miller Aviation Co Pty. Ltd. was founded by Horrie C. Miller & Sir MacPherson Robertson, the millionaire confectionery manufacturer. It was not registered until 28 May 1928.\nIn October 1934, MacRobertson-Miller Aviation transferred its main base to Perth, after it won the Commonwealth Government's contract for North-West services, previously operated by West Australian Airways\nIn 1955, MacRobertson-Miller Aviation Co. Pty. Ltd. & Airlines (W.A.) Ltd. were merged, to form MacRobertson Miller Airlines Ltd., at the request of the State Government. MacRobertson Miller Airlines Ltd. began operations; combining the operations of MacRobertson Miller Aviation Co. Ltd. and Airlines (W.A.)

This scheme was adopted with the introduction of the first of the new Fokker F28 Fellowship 4000 series after Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch acquired control of the Ansett Group, as part of a restructuring of the local divisions.\nAirlines of Western Australia was then renamed Ansett WA in 1984 and once again it adopted the parent companies livery and image. It was also briefly named Air WA prior to naming it Ansett WA, although this only appeared on a single BAe 146 aircraft which was repainted Ansett WA before entering line service.  In 1993 the division was absorbed by Ansett, and any connection with its Western Australian heritage vanished. On 14 September 2001 Ansett collapsed. By the time it became an integral part of the Ansett group, it was Australia's oldest continually-operating domestic airline, and one of the oldest airlines in the world.\nMMA was affectionately referred to by the West Australian locals as \"Mickey Mouse Airlines\".\nMMA operated out of Perth Airport. The main road leading into Perth Airport's International Terminal 1 is named after Horrie Miller.\nMMA usually named its aircraft after Western Australian rivers, and the last letter of the aircraft registration reflected this i.e. Fokker F27 \"RMA SWAN\" had VH-MMS, \"RMA ROBE\" VH-MMR etc. One exception was Fokker F27 VH-MMU, \"RMA MABUHAY\", leased from Philippine Airlines. The name meant \"welcome\" in one of the Filipino dialects.\nThe F28s were named after Western Australian regions (Pilbara, Kimberley, Goldfields etc.), and the F28s' registrations \"FK\" prefix reflected the aircraft manufacturer, Fokker.

This variety is good for boiling, baking, and mashing, and can be used for brightly coloured salads. Unlike many blue potatoes, it does not turn grey after boiling. 'Adirondack Blue' was bred from N40-1 ('Chieftain' x 'Black Russian') x NY96 and is not under plant variety protection.\n'Adirondack Blue' has large and spreading foliage.

All his life he explored the role of civic and personal virtue, as expressed in Poor Richard's aphorisms. Franklin felt that organized religion was necessary to keep men good to their fellow men, but rarely attended religious services himself. When Franklin met Voltaire in Paris and asked his fellow member of the Enlightenment vanguard to bless his grandson, Voltaire said in English, \"God and Liberty\", and added, \"this is the only appropriate benediction for the grandson of Monsieur Franklin.\"\nFranklin's parents were both pious Puritans. The family attended the Old South Church, the most liberal Puritan congregation in Boston, where Benjamin Franklin was baptized in 1706. Franklin's father, a poor chandler, owned a copy of a book, Bonifacius: Essays to Do Good, by the Puritan preacher and family friend Cotton Mather, which Franklin often cited as a key influence on his life. Franklin's first pen name, Silence Dogood, paid homage both to the book and to a widely known sermon by Mather. The book preached the importance of forming voluntary associations to benefit society. Franklin learned about forming do-good associations from Cotton Mather, but his organizational skills made him the most influential force in making voluntarism an enduring part of the American ethos.\nFranklin formulated a presentation of his beliefs and published it in 1728. It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas regarding salvation, the divinity of Jesus, or indeed much religious dogma. He clarified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography, although still considered himself a Christian. He retained a strong faith in a God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.\nIt was Ben Franklin who, at a critical impasse during the Constitutional Convention in June 1787, attempted to introduce the practice of daily common prayer with these words:\n...\u00a0In the beginning of the contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine Protection. Our prayers, Sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor.\u00a0... And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth\u2014that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the sacred writings that \"except the Lord build they labor in vain that build it.\" I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:\u00a0... I therefore beg leave to move\u2014that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that service.\nThe motion met with resistance and was never brought to a vote.\nFranklin was an enthusiastic supporter of the evangelical minister George Whitefield during the First Great Awakening. Franklin did not subscribe to Whitefield's theology, but he admired Whitefield for exhorting people to worship God through good works. Franklin published all of Whitefield's sermons and journals, thereby earning a lot of money and boosting the Great Awakening.\nWhen he stopped attending church, Franklin wrote in his autobiography:\n...\u00a0Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that He made the world, and governed it by His providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doi", "Haploembia solieri is a species of webspinner in the family Oligotomidae.

Edith thought she was safe with Modwenna who was not expecting her visit. On the third day, Edith, wondering that her pupil had not returned, went to Modwenna. The abbesses were greatly concerned when they discovered Osgyth was apparently lost. They searched for her and found the child lying near the banks of the stream. The abbesses prayed for her restoration, and commanded her to arise from the water and come to them. This she did. A similar tale is found in Irish hagiography.\nHer later death was accounted a martyrdom by some, but Bede makes no mention of Saint Osgyth. The 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris repeats some of the legend that had accrued around her name. The site of her martyrdom became transferred to the holy spring at Quarrendon. The holy spring at Quarrendon, mentioned in the time of Osgyth's aunts, now became associated with her legend, in which Osgyth stood up after her execution, picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris, and other cephalophoric martyrs and walking with it in her hands, to the door of a local convent, before collapsing there.

It is said that he asked to be buried this way so when the Final Redemption occurs, Rabbi Meir would be spared the trouble of arising from his grave and could just walk out to greet the Jewish Messiah. He requested that he be buried in Eretz Yisrael by the seashore so that the water that washes the shores  should also lap his grave. Visitors to his grave traditionally recite Tehillim and a special prayer. Every year, thousands of Jews make pilgrimage to his grave to receive blessings for health and success, in particular on his yahrtzeit (anniversary of his death) the 14th of Iyar, which is also Pesach Sheni (known as the holiday of the 'second chance').\nFour tombs in Israel and one or two in Iraq have over time been associated with Rabbi Meir.

The first clear mention of a tomb of Rabbi Meir in this place was made in the early 13th century by Samuel ben Samson, but he also mentioned a tomb of Rabbi Meir in Jish, as did many other writers in the following centuries. There was also until the 16th century some disagreement over which Rabbi Meir was buried here.  For example, Moses ben Mordecai Bassola, while noting the story that the person here was buried standing up, stated explicitly that it was a Rabbi Meir different than the tanna.

Even so, there exists a \"notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times\". Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of Persian miniatures as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the Persianate world (Warka and Gulshah, Topkapi Palace Library H. 841, attributed to Konya 1200\u20131250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.\nThis book dates to before or just around the time of the Mongol invasion of Anatolia in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).\nChristiane Gruber traces a development from \"veristic\" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more \"abstract\" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of calligraphic representation, with the older types also remaining in use.  An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the \"inscribed portrait\" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with \"Ya Muhammad\" (\"O Muhammad\") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to Sufi thought.  In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen. According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent iconoclastic mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.\nA number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the Ilkhanid period under the new Mongol rulers, including a Marzubannama dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid MS Arab 161 of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of Al-Biruni's The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and `Ali according to Shi`ite doctrine. According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote Sunni Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century, although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the Jalayrid period of Shia rulers.\nDepictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following Timurid and Safavid dynasties, and Turkish Ottoman art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography Siyer-i Nebi commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Murat III for his son, the future Mehmed III, containing over 800 illustrations.\nProbably the commonest narrative scene represented is the Mi'raj; according to Gruber, \"There exist countless single-page paintings of the me\u02bfr\u0101j included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century\".  These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 Rajab, when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: \"Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences\".  Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from muc", "First National Bank Building is a historic bank building located at Creedmoor, Granville County, North Carolina.

Casts of Diplodocus skeletons are still displayed in many museums worldwide, including D. carnegii in a number of institutions.\nThis project, along with its association with 'big science', philanthropism, and capitalism, drew much public attention in Europe.

Named for the town of Emden, she was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Dockyard) in Danzig in 1906. The hull was launched in May 1908, and completed in July 1909. She had one sister ship, Dresden. Like the preceding K\u00f6nigsberg-class cruisers, Emden was armed with ten 10.5\u00a0cm (4.1\u00a0in) guns and two torpedo tubes.\nEmden spent the majority of her career overseas in the German East Asia Squadron, based in Tsingtao, in the Kiautschou Bay concession in China. In 1913, Karl von M\u00fcller took command of the ship. At the outbreak of World War I, Emden captured a Russian steamer and converted her into the commerce raider Cormoran. Emden rejoined the East Asia Squadron, then was detached for independent raiding in the Indian Ocean. The cruiser spent nearly two months operating in the region, and captured nearly two dozen ships. On 28 October 1914, Emden launched a surprise attack on Penang; in the resulting Battle of Penang, she sank the Russian cruiser Zhemchug and the French destroyer Mousquet.\nM\u00fcller then took Emden to raid the Cocos Islands, where he landed a contingent of sailors to destroy British facilities. There, Emden was attacked by the Australian cruiser HMAS\u00a0Sydney on 9 November 1914. The more powerful Australian ship quickly inflicted serious damage and forced M\u00fcller to run his ship aground to avoid sinking. Out of a crew of 376, 133 were killed in the battle. Most of the survivors were taken prisoner; the landing party, led by Hellmuth von M\u00fccke, commandeered an old schooner and eventually returned to Germany.

Salting, either with dry salt or brine, was a common method of preserving meat until the middle of the 20th century, becoming less popular after the advent of refrigeration. It was frequently called \"junk\" or \"salt horse\".\nSalt inhibits the growth of microorganisms by drawing water out of microbial cells through osmosis. Concentrations of salt up to 20% are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria. Smoking, often used in the process of curing meat, adds chemicals to the surface of meat that reduce the concentration of salt required.\nSalted meat and fish are a staple of the diet in North Africa, Southern China,  Scandinavia, coastal Russia, and in the Arctic. Salted meat was a staple of the mariner's diet in the Age of Sail. It was stored in barrels, and often had to last for months spent out of sight of land. The basic Royal Navy diet consisted of salted beef, salted pork, ship's biscuit, and oatmeal, supplemented with smaller quantities of peas, cheese and butter.  Even in 1938, Eric Newby found the diet on the tall ship Moshulu to consist almost entirely of salted meat.  Moshulu's lack of refrigeration left little choice as the ship made voyages which could exceed 100 days passage between ports.", "A railway bridge across the Volga was built in 1912\u20131916 and two automobile lanes were added to it in 1953\u20131958, allowing for the city to expand on the Eastern (left) bank of the river and transforming it into a local transport hub.\nAccording to Ulyanovsk Region Development Corporation, Ulyanovsk Region is conveniently situated in the center of the European part of Russia, where east west and north south air, rail, car and river routes cross.

Ulyanovsk transport hub provides all forms of transport (busy river port and passenger terminal, railways with two major passenger and cargo stations, airports and now two major bridges) apart from sea, which can serve Russian and international cargo traffic to Kazakhstan, Central Asia and South East Asia, Europe, China and back.\nAs the aging Ulyanovsk bridge, the only crossing of the Volga in the 400\u00a0km stretch from Kazan to Tolyatti, could no longer cope with the growing needs of the city, the construction of President Bridge, a truss bridge, began in the late 1980s. Completion was delayed significantly due to catastrophic economic circumstances following the end of the Soviet Union. Its official opening ceremony was on November 24, 2009 by the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev \u2013 although traffic was using the bridge a few days earlier.

She had been en route in ballast from Portsmouth to Dakar.\nLagosian was not so lucky. In September 1940 she was bombed in the North Sea with the loss of five lives. Like the Conakrian, which was torpedoed in October 1940, she was able to reach port, but on 18 November 1940 the Congonian was the first ship to be lost. She was torpedoed off Freetown by U-65.\nA different fate befell the Takoradian and Gambian however. They had entered Dakar for diesel bunkers, and on 5 July 1940, shortly after the fall of France, they were boarded by Vichy French officials and impounded. They were not released until 1943.\nAt sea the losses continued. On 5 August 1941 the Kumasian was sunk by torpedo off the Irish Coast by U-74.

She soon disappeared, in fact they did not have time to lower any boats and had to jump for it. They were later picked up by one of the escort vessels, but there were 13 missing when a roll call was taken. About 0430 hours the same night we were hit amidships as was the John Holt, the Commodore ship, and another ship belonging to Elders. There now remained four vessels out of the 13 which left Freetown, but I did hear that the remaining four reached their destination.\nWhen I reached the bridge after we were hit my Chief Officer, Mr Croft, asked if he could lower the lifeboats. I could feel the ship was doomed as she was filling up and taking a list to starboard. I of course agreed and then went forward to the sailor's and firemen's quarters to make sure that none had slept through it. I found no one and returned amidships where all the officers and crew were assembled, all accounted for. We lowered the boats and while the men were filling them an apparition in white flew past me.

The city of Rochester forms the core of a much larger suburban, and rural area. Rochester has a greater metro population of around 1 million people, across six counties.\nRochester was one of the United States' first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile Genesee River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing center which spurred further rapid population growth. The city rose to prominence as the birthplace and home of some of America's most iconic companies, in particular Eastman Kodak, Xerox and Bausch & Lomb (along with Wegmans, Gannett, Paychex, Western Union, French's, Constellation Brands, Rag\u00fa, and others) which saw the region become a global center for science, technology, research and development. This status has been aided by the presence of several internationally renowned universities (notably the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology) and their research programs; these schools along with many other smaller colleges have played an increasingly large role in Greater Rochester's economy. Rochester has also played a key part in US history as a hub for certain important social/political movements, especially Abolitionism and the Women's Rights Movement While the city experienced some significant population loss as a result of deindustrialization, strong growth in the education and healthcare sectors boosted by elite universities and the slower decline of bedrock companies like Eastman Kodak and Xerox (as opposed to the rapid fall of heavy industry like with steel companies in Buffalo and Pittsburgh) resulted in a much less severe contraction than in most rust belt metros.\nToday, Rochester's economy is defined by technology and education (aided by a highly educated workforce, research institutions and other strengths born in its past). The Rochester metropolitan area is the fourth-largest regional economy in New York State, after the New York City metropolitan area Buffalo, and Albany. Rochester's gross metropolitan product is 57 billion above Albany and Syracuse and, below Buffalo.  Rochester is also known for its culture, in particular its music culture; institutions like the Eastman School of Music (considered to be one of the most prestigious conservatories in the world) and the Rochester International Jazz Festival anchor a vibrant music industry, ranked as one of the top ten music scenes in the US in terms of the concentration of musicians and music-related business. It is the site of multiple major festivals every year (such as the Lilac Festival, the aforementioned Jazz Festival, the Rochester Fringe Festival and others which draw hundreds of thousands of attendees each) and is home to several world-famous museums such as The Strong National Museum of Play and the George Eastman Museum, the oldest photography collection in the world and one of the largest). The Rochester Metro is ranked highly in terms of livability and quality of life and is often considered to be one of the best places in America for families due to low cost of living, highly ranked public schoolsand a low unemployment rate. However, there is a great divide between its inner city component (which has at times had the highest child poverty rate in the nation) and its affluent, well-educated southern suburbs.

Also taken was a 10-inch-tall (25\u00a0cm) French Imperial Eagle finial from the corner of a framed flag for Napoleon's Imperial Guard. There is a $100,000 reward for information leading to the return of the finial alone. It possibly appeared like gold to the thieves. Chez Tortoni by French painter \u00c9douard Manet (1832\u20131883) was taken from the Blue Room; it was the only item taken from the first floor.\nThe eclectic mix of items has puzzled experts. While some of the paintings were valuable, the thieves passed other valuable works by Raphael, Botticelli, and Michelangelo and left them undisturbed, opting to take relatively valueless items like the gu and finial. The thieves never entered the third floor where Titian's The Rape of Europa hung, one of the most valuable paintings in the city. The selection of works and the brutish ways the thieves handled the artwork has led investigators to believe the thieves were not experts commissioned to steal particular works.\nAs Gardner's will decreed nothing in her collection should be moved, the empty frames for the stolen paintings remain hanging in their respective locations in the museum as placeholders for their potential return. Because of the museum's low funds and lack of an insurance policy, the director solicited help from Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses to post a reward of $1 million within three days. This was increased to $5 million in 1997. In 2017, it was doubled to $10 million with an expiration date set for the end of the year. This reward was extended following an outpouring of tips from the public. It is the largest bounty ever offered by a private institution. The reward is for \"information that leads directly to the recovery of all of [their] items in good condition\".

Their purpose is to produce the desired magnetic susceptibility (magnetic response) in various types of metamaterials up to 200 terahertz. These media create the necessary strong magnetic coupling to an applied electromagnetic field, not otherwise available in conventional materials. For example, an effect such as negative permeability is produced with a periodic array of split ring resonators.\nA single cell SRR has a pair of enclosed loops with splits in them at opposite ends. The loops are made of nonmagnetic metal like copper and have a small gap between them. The loops can be concentric, or square, and gapped as needed. A magnetic flux penetrating the metal rings will induce rotating currents in the rings, which produce their own flux to enhance or oppose the incident field (depending on the SRRs resonant properties). This field pattern is dipolar. The small gaps between the rings produces large capacitance values which lower the resonating frequency. Hence the dimensions of the structure are small compared to the resonant wavelength. This results in low radiative losses, and very high quality factors.", "Epicallima icterinella is a moth of the family Oecophoridae.

Bishops certainly existed in areas from the earliest Christian times (often from Irish monastic missionary activity), but the territory over which an early (often monastic) bishop operated was limited and ill-defined. Hence the term \"bishop's church\" is sometimes used for a seat used by an early bishop rather than the word \"cathedral\" which some expect to be attached to a formal diocese. Traditionally, the medieval Scottish diocesan system was held to have been largely created by King David I (reigned 1124-1153), though this is an oversimplification.\nAs the Scottish Reformation of 1560 developed, bishops and cathedrals became progressively marginalised and neglected. By Act of the Scottish Parliament 1690 (confirming the Church's own final decision of 1689) the Church of Scotland finally became wholly Presbyterian, with no dioceses, no bishops, so no functioning cathedrals. At that date all Church of Scotland cathedrals became former cathedrals.

Specifically, USP domains are characterized for having interspered points with insertions in the catalytic domain. This insertions have the capacity of folding into independent domains that can be involved in the regulation of the enzyme's activity.\nAll USP domains, including USP27X, can be divided into six conserved boxes that are mapped onto the USP domain core structure. These structures have been identified through multilple sequence alignment of the USP catalytic cores. Box 1 is known to contain the catalytic cysteine (Cys) residue, box 5 contains the catalytic histidine (His) residue, box 6 contains the catalytic asparagine (Asn)/ aspartate (Asp) residue. Box 3 and box 4 can vary its content although in most human USP enzyme domains each contain a conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif, which is commonly associated with a zinc-binding site.\nUSP27X has a length of 438 aminoacids.

Hammond and William M. Trimble. At the time, Arlington was a small rural North Texas town with a population of about 1,000 people. Its public schools were underfunded and generally inadequate, a problem that was made more acute by the fact that the median age in Arlington was 20 and a third of its residents were under age 10. Arlington College was the first of a series of private schools to exist on the site of the present University of Texas at Arlington. From the beginning it was championed by civic booster Emmett Rankin, a native of Tennessee who moved to Arlington in 1874 and established the Rankin Hardware Company. He hoped to raise the standard of education in the then-rural town. A private school, Arlington College consisted of the rough equivalent of elementary through high school levels, with students spanning approximately from first grade through tenth grade.\nArlington College charged tuition that ranged between $1.50 and $3.50 per month per student. The school had a faculty of six teachers and taught subjects ranging from algebra, grammar, and Latin to art, elocution, and penmanship. In 1895\u201396, the school's inaugural year, it had about 75 students, and it grew to approximately 120 in 1896\u201397 and 150 in 1897\u201398. It held its first commencement in May 1898, at which only two students graduated from the equivalent of high school. In May 1900, four students graduated.\nArlington College's original wood-frame schoolhouse stood near the current university's University Center, on land donated by James Ditto and A. W. Collins that was at the time one mile (1.6\u00a0km) southwest of Arlington. Built at a cost of $5,000, the two-story schoolhouse lacked indoor plumbing but contained six classrooms and an assembly room. Rankin convinced Lee Morgan Hammond and William M. Trimble, the two co-principals of the Arlington Public School, to start Arlington College and invest $500 each in it. Hammond had been born in Alabama in 1869 and Trimble had been born in Tarrant County, Texas, in 1868. Both were educated at Bedford College and Sam Houston Normal Institute before they arrived in Arlington to become co-principals of the Arlington Public School in 1894.\nDuring the 1896\u201397 academic year, Arlington College agreed to provide places for public school students for a duration of five months in exchange for receiving two-thirds of Arlington's public education funding, an agreement that lasted until 1900. Perhaps because of the unsatisfactory nature of this agreement, Trimble sold his interest in Arlington College in 1898 and Hammond did likewise in 1900. That year, the Arlington College Corporation was established to run the school, with newly appointed president W. W. Franklin of Dallas. The new corporation and its trustees sold stock in an effort to save the school. In July 1900, Arlington College filed a charter for $4,000 in capital stock. In 1901, its faculty consisted of four teachers. In the summer of that year, the school's trustees declared Arlington College's building to be \"unsafe and wholly unfit\" before a proposition to transfer the school's administration from the trustees to the city was defeated by Arlington voters.\nIn August 1901, the college and the city came to an agreement by which the public school would rent the Arlington College building for $350, while the college retained just one room and one teacher. Throughout the 1901\u201302 academic year, the local newspaper, The Arlington Journal, pressured for school reform and the creation of an independent school district that would have the means to construct a new brick building. In April 1902, Arlington voters passed a proposition to create an independent school district (which officially became the Arlington Independent School District with legislative validation a year later) by a margin of three-to-one, while later that spring they also approved a $12,000 bond issue to fund school construction.

Eggs are laid from early summer to mid autumn. Adult females probably lay two egg batches a season, each containing between 20\u201332 eggs. The majority of nymph emergence occurs in mid-summer, but early instar B. robustus have been seen later in the season. Because of the timing of emergence, it is thought eggs require a winter period in order to develop fully. This not an uncommon requirement for New Zealand grasshoppers.  The nymphs then overwinter, often surviving temperatures well below 0\u00a0\u00b0C, and reach adulthood the following summer. Adult males will copulate with multiple females and vice versa, suggesting this species has a promiscuous mating system. The ratio of male to female B. robustus alters over New Zealand summer: at the start of the summer in November the ratio is 56% male and 44% female. By December females (57%) outnumber males (43%).

In October 1778, with his sloop, the 'Lady Dunmore', Captain William Goodrich captured a brigantine called the Bold Defence, bound for Baltimore. The ship 'Lady Dunmore' was named after the wife of Lord Dunmore, the Governor of Virginia. Around the same time, William also captured an armed schooner called Liberty, which put up some resistance, killing one man and wounding two others. However, Goodrich's men, boarded the Liberty with their cutlasses in their teeth and captured her.\nIn December 1778, he captured a French Brig, carrying coffee and indigo, said to be worth \u00a312,000. In December 1779, he captured a sloop laden with tobacco and carried it in to New York. In December 1780, he captured a Spanish ship, carrying 38,000 dollars, 40,000lbs of Spanish Indigo, 50 hogsheads of sugar, some tobacco and many other valuable items.\nIn 1783, with the war of Independence over, he sailed to Britain and settled in Bristol, with the rest of his family. However, in 1794, William Goodrich decided to retire to the Isle of Wight and bought the Spring Hill estate. At that time, the house was described as being characterised by no peculiarities of design, but standing on the brow of a hill, it commanded a magnificent view of the Solent. The neighbourhood was described as being extremely beautiful, being almost entirely covered with charming seats and villas. His neighbours included Lord Henry Seymour of the adjoining Norris Castle and on the other side by the famous architect John Nash at East Cowes Castle.\nLife must have seemed very quiet for him there, after all of his adventures in the Americas. One of his concerns in 1803, was to threaten in the local papers to prosecute anyone caught taking sand or soil from the seashore of Spring Hill. However, of more significance in 1803, was that Lieutenant general James Arnold of the Royal Engineers, stayed with Goodrich at Spring Hill whilst awaiting his convoy's departure to the West Indies. He was the son of the renowned American General Benedict Arnold, who famously fought for both sides during the American War of Independence. One of the reasons given for why James stayed at Spring Hill was the fact that the estate was within sight of his ship. In 1807, he married Virginia Goodrich.\nWilliam became a churchwarden of St Mildred's Church, Whippingham and would have been involved in its demolition in 1804, followed by it being rebuilt to another design by John Nash. He had involvement in local highway administration and was a member of the board that examined and licensed the seventy pilot boats that operated from Cowes.\nWilliam Goodrich and his family stayed at Spring Hill until 1812, moving out to another 'cottage orn\u00e9' in East Cowes, also designed for them by John Nash, so that George and Mary Shedden, together with their fourteen children, could take over the more spacious Spring Hill. William Goodrich died at Slatwoods in 1816, by that time owned by Robert Shedden, who had also joined the Goodrich's on the Isle of Wight. Slatwoods itself was a sumptuous estate of 23 acres, with the house consisting of thirteen bed and dressing rooms.

By 1868 the Masons included showmanship as part of their funeral processions at cemeteries in New Orleans. All Saints Day was also a festive event at New Orleans cemeteries in the latter nineteenth century through the early twentieth century.\nBenevolent societies in New Orleans in the middle of the nineteenth century began to include pageantry as part of unveiling their society tombs. These preceded the widespread practice of Jazz funerals, the origin of which began with African-American slaves in New Orleans. Examples from this time period include the German Washington Benevolent Association and the New Lusitanos Benevolent Association.\nThese festivities eventually extended to include Jazz funerals, typically originating at a church and ending with musical performances in the cemetery itself. The West African burial tradition of lamentations culminating in joviality was observed in New Orleans at funerals as early as 1819. By the time of emancipation from slavery, brass bands became commonplace at funerals of African-Americans in New Orleans. With the rise of benevolent associations for African-Americans in New Orleans, jazz funerals could be had for a suitable fee. In contemporary times, these have included men and women who have died tragically at a young age. Jazz funerals are often spectacles at cemeteries in New Orleans.", "Cars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of weddings and graduations.\nA frequent wedding tradition in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony.

Jan Brunvand's American Folklore: An Encyclopedia speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the shivaree, a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when honeymoon travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.\nSome cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as limousines.", "Victoria Terrasse is an historic  building complex located in central Oslo, Norway.

They laid emphasis on the building of civic buildings around the Chaugan to conceal the unorthodox structural layout of the residential complexes. The western oriented development programme grew particularly active after the arrival of Major Blair Reid in January 1863, during the reign of Raja Shri Singh. The next fourteen years in particular, until his retirement in March 1877, were characterised by large-scale building projects in Chamba, with Reid fully revising the administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganising the state machinery to make development more efficient.\nOrderly new building complexes with \"simple visual discipline with white plastered walls, lancer arch windows, cornices, sloping sheet roofs, wooden eaves and deep verandahs were planned and built\".  Road communications were dramatically improved, with the approach road to the town being diverted, to provide a way for vehicular traffic to enter from the western end of the chaugan. A cabled suspension bridge was built across the Ravi River in the lower outskirts of the town, and many important public welfare projects were started, and well as many temples, gates, gardens and churches between 1863 and 1910. Notable works built during the colonial period include the temples in the Jansali Bazar, Gandhi Gate (Curzon Gate), Shiva Temple, the Chaugans, the Police Lines, the Church of Scotland, the Shyam Singh Hospital (built in 1891), Chamba Library,  the Post Office building, Bhuri Singh Museum, the State Forces barracks, and the administrative buildings of the British period.

Pugin had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1835, and spent most of the remainder of his working life designing Catholic churches, their fittings and vestments. St Chad's was the first large church that he designed which was planned, from the outset in 1837, to become a cathedral. Pugin lavished much care on the building, and described, in his letters, not only the architecture, but its decoration, fittings and furnishings. The Clerk of Works and builder of St Chad's was George Myers.\nSt Chad's replaced a smaller church dedicated to St Austin, built on the same site in 1808, in the Gunmakers' Quarter of the town on steeply sloping land that fell away to the canal and wharf. Because of the narrow site, and the necessity to build in brick rather than stone, Pugin was restricted in the style and proportions of the church that he could design. Because he wished to make the church as open and spacious as possible, he looked as a model to the style of churches that were built in Northern Germany in the late Middle Ages. St Chad's is built in the style of a brick hall church or \"hallenkirke\", similar to Munich Cathedral and has a westwerk with narrow broached spires similar to those of L\u00fcbeck Cathedral. Because of the steep slope of the site, Pugin built a large crypt beneath the building, to be used primarily as a burial place for family tombs, and former cathedral clergy, and is now rehearsal room for the choir. The geographical alignment is unusual in that the \"east end\" (the location of the altar) actually faces approximately north west.\nThe interior, the nave of which is almost twice as high as it is wide, has a very high arcade, like German hall churches, carried on clusters of thin shafts, those of the chancel being decorated in paint and gold leaf with a helical pattern like a barber's pole, bearing the legend Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth ('Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts'). The wooden ceiling, with curving blue trusses, is ornamented with monograms and floral patterns, inspired by the remnants of medieval decoration to be found on the ancient ceilings of Ely and Peterborough Cathedrals. Phoebe Stanton describes the ornate decoration of the ceiling as \"brilliant\" and so delicate that \"it resembles fabric stretched over a lattice\".\nPugin designed many of the fittings including the high altar under an elaborate baldachin, with riddel posts, and the choir screen.  The Bishop's Chair, in oak upholstered in green velvet, backed with the diocesan shield of arms was also designed by Pugin. Other fittings, such the 16th century carved pulpit and the medieval canons' stalls were from churches in Belgium and Germany respectively and were collected and donated by John Talbot, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury. The sanctuary windows are the work of William Warrington. Other windows, metalwork, fittings and vestments were provided by John Hardman of Birmingham, to the design or specifications of Pugin. Hardman was a parishioner of St Chad's, founding the Cathedral Choir in 1854. Four generations of his family are among those interred in the crypt.\nIn 1932 St. Chad's was extended by the addition of St Edward's Chapel, designed by Pugin's grandson, Sebastian Pugin Powell, and built in memory of Archbishop Edward Ilsley and his patron St. Edward the Confessor. The chapel windows depict the history of the relics of St. Chad, and those who have served the church there, along with some magnificent ecclesiastical coats of arms.\nIn the 1960s a number of the fittings, including Pugin's screen, were removed and the interior repainted, to the detriment of the original design. The rood screen was rescued by an Anglican priest, who had it re-erected in the Anglican Holy Trinity Church, Reading. Other artefacts were removed to other churches, including the giant rood crucifix, which after its removal to the Church of the Sacred Heart & St Therese, in Coleshill, was reinstated in the cathedr", "Significant production of highbush blueberries occurs in British Columbia, Maryland, Western Oregon, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington.

The Ottomans had not captured a city before; the lack of expertise and adequate siege equipment at this stage of the war meant that the city fell only after six or nine years. \nThe historian, Laonikos Chalkokondyles, notes that the Ottomans took advantage of the Byzantine civil war of 1321\u20131328 to capture the city: \"Andronikos decided that he should hold the throne himself, as his grandfather had already grown old, and so they fell out with each other. He was too stubborn to submit and caused endless trouble. He brought in the Serbs and allied himself with the leading Greeks in his struggle for the throne. As a result they could do nothing to prevent the Turks from crossing over into Europe. It was at this time that Prusa was besieged, starved out, and taken by Osman, and other cities in Asia were captured.\"\nAccording to some sources Osman I died of natural causes just before the fall of the city, while others suggest that he lived long enough to hear about the victory on his death-bed and was buried in Bursa afterwards.", "The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city. Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This \"inclusive\" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured\u2014and possibly less functional and more simplistic\u2014work of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with \"impure\" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House).\nVenturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. In his architectural design Venturi was influenced by early masters such as Michelangelo and Palladio, and modern masters including Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married Denise Scott Brown on July 23, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in Manayunk, Philadelphia, was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1985.  The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, Toulouse, and Japan.\nVenturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms.  The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M. Stern, Rem Koolhaas, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Graham Gund and James Stirling, among others.\nVenturi was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects, The American Academy of Arts and Letters and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.", "Suillus variegatus is edible, but is said to smell unpleasant, with a somewhat metallic taste.

After funding for the transit center had been secured, the project's environmental impact statement was released in 2004. The project was still undergoing revisions as of mid-2005, and was to be completed by October 2005. Construction was set to begin later that year.\nFunding problems began in June 2005, when the original plans were cut back. The projected cost of the Fulton Street Transit Center had grown by $75 million, to $825 million. The design had been delayed to May 2006, and the proposed completion date was now December 2008. In March 2006, the land under the Corbin Building was taken for the proposed transit center by eminent domain. A block to the north, the MTA began the process of evicting and relocating 148 store owners near the site of the transit center's main building.  The budget of real-estate acquisition also rose from $50 million to $157 million. This cost increase was a key factor in the ballooning costs of the transit center over the next several years.\nBy May 2006, the budget was nearing $850 million, and the planned completion date was delayed to June 2009. Despite the $45 million budget overrun, the MTA denied that the Fulton Center plan would be curtailed.  In November 2006, the MTA announced the creation of a free transfer between the Cortlandt\u2013Church Streets and World Trade Center stations, which would cost $15 million more. By February 2007, the projected cost had risen to $888 million, and the MTA pledged to pay for the $41 million gap with its own money. The completion date was now projected as October 2009.\nMeanwhile, the costs of other MTA Capital Construction projects were rising as well. The issue peaked in January 2008, when the MTA announced that three other capital projects (the 7 Subway Extension, the Second Avenue Subway, and East Side Access) were facing a combined cost overrun of $1 billion. To remedy the overrun, plans for the Fulton Center's main building had to be downsized: instead of being a 114-foot-high (35\u00a0m) structure with a large dome, the headhouse would now be a simple stainless-steel building with a smaller dome.  The project, excluding the main building, was now expected to cost $903 million. The main building would cost another $250 million, if built. The cost overruns were attributed to the fact that the MTA had received a single, $870 million bid for one phase of construction, more than twice the $408 million the MTA had originally set aside for that phase. The date of completion was now set for 2010, and the MTA had ordered a 30-day review of the Fulton Center plan. Around the same time, the neighboring World Trade Center Hub's costs also rose from $2.2 billion to $3.4 billion.\nThe funding reductions also resulted in several design cutbacks. The free transfer from the Cortlandt\u2013Church Streets and World Trade Center stations was dropped from the plans, but was later restored using MTA funds before being dropped and restored again. The passageway underneath Dey Street was narrowed from 40 to 29 feet (12 to 9\u00a0m). The MTA deleted the main building from the plan to reduce costs. In March 2008, the MTA announced that it would spend $295 million on an as-yet-undetermined structure at the location of the main building. One proposal included constructing the main building with a performing arts center, rather than a dome, on top. By this time, the MTA lacked several billion dollars in funding for its 2010\u20132014 capital spending plan. The MTA did not rule out the possibility of converting almost the entire plot into a public plaza and constructing a simple subway entrance from the plaza.

It has one large basal leaf, up to 25\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in) across, with five to seven lobes. The leaves and flowers sprout from a reddish rhizome with bright orange sap that grows at or slightly below the soil surface. The color of the sap is the reason for the genus name Sanguinaria, from Latin sanguinarius \"bloody\". The rhizomes grow longer each year, and branch to form colonies. Plants start to bloom before the foliage unfolds in early spring. After blooming the leaves unfurl to their full size and go summer dormant in mid to late summer, later than some other spring ephemerals.\nThe flowers bloom from March to May depending on the region and weather. They have 8\u201312 delicate white petals, many yellow stamens, and two sepals below the petals, which fall off after the flowers open. Each flower stem is clasped by a leaf as it emerges from the ground. The flowers open when they are in sunlight. They are pollinated by small bees and flies.

Many venomous snakes are specialized predators whose venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate their preferred prey. A number of other factors are also critical in determining the potential hazard of any given venomous snake to humans, including their distribution and behavior. For example, while the inland taipan is regarded as the world's most venomous snake based on LD\u2085\u2080 tests on mice, it is a shy species and rarely strikes, and has not caused any known human fatalities. On the other hand, India's Big Four (Indian Cobra, common Krait, Russell's viper, and saw-scaled viper), while less venomous than the inland taipan, are found in closer proximity to human settlements and are more confrontational, thus leading to more deaths from snakebite. In addition, some species, such as the black mamba and coastal taipan, occasionally show some aggression, generally when alarmed or in self-defence, and then may deliver fatal doses of venom, resulting in high human mortality rates.", "Valle Vigezzo (Vigezzo Valley) is a valley in the Lepontine Alps in northwestern Italy on the border with Canton Ticino of Switzerland. It forms the eastern branch of the Ossola valley. It is also called the Valle dei Pittori (Valley of the Painters) due to the large number of painters over the centuries such as Giuseppe Mattia Borgnis, Lorenzo Peretti, Bernardino Peretti, Enrico Cavalli, Carlo Fornara, Giovanni Battista Ciolina, Gian Maria Rastellini, Maurizio Borgnis, Lorenzo Peretti Junior. It is remembered for its \"spazzacamini\" or chimney-sweepers who brought their trade around Europe.

It is central to its cosmology, and a major pilgrimage site for some Buddhist traditions.\nVajrayana Buddhists believe that Mount Kailash is the home of the buddha Cakrasa\u1e43vara (also known as Demchok), who represents supreme bliss.\nThere are numerous sites in the region associated with Padmasambhava, whose tantric practices in holy sites around Tibet are credited with finally establishing Buddhism as the main religion of the country in the 7th\u20138th century AD.\nIt is said that Milarepa (c. 1052 \u2013 c. 1135), champion of Vajrayana, arrived in Tibet to challenge Naro B\u00f6nchung, champion of the B\u00f6n religion of Tibet. The two magicians engaged in a terrifying sorcerers' battle, but neither was able to gain a decisive advantage. Finally, it was agreed that whoever could reach the summit of Kailash most rapidly would be the victor. While Naro B\u00f6nchung sat on magic drum and soared up the slope, Milarepa's followers were dumbfounded to see him sitting still and meditating. Yet when Naro B\u00f6nchung was nearly at the top, Milarepa suddenly moved into action and overtook him by riding on sunlight, thus winning the contest. He did, however, fling a handful of snow on to the top of a nearby mountain, since known as B\u00f6nri, bequeathing it to the B\u00f6npo and thereby ensuring continued B\u00f6npo connections with the region.", "Goran Vojnovi\u0107 (born 11 June 1980) is a Slovenian writer, poet, screenwriter and film director.

He studied at the Academy for Theatre, Radio, Film and Television. He published his first collection of poetry Lep je ta svet in 1998. His novel \u010cefurji raus! started out as an unfinished film script.

She was offered the position after Darren Brass broke his elbow, preventing him from tattooing. She had a falling out with Ami James, which led to her decision to leave the shop and the show.\nShe subsequently acquired her own TLC series, LA Ink, which chronicled her work at her tattoo shop, High Voltage Tattoo, in Hollywood, California. On the show, she broke the Guinness World Record of most tattoos given by a single person in 24 hours, with a total of 400. Accomplished in December 2007, it involved a Von D-designed logo for the city of Los Angeles, with proceeds going to the children's-blindness charity Vitamin Angels.  LA Ink ran four seasons, ending September 15, 2011; TLC announced the cancellation on August 18, 2011. Von D has publicly said that the cancellation was because she chose not to continue doing the show.\nHer first book, High Voltage Tattoo, compiling her artworks and tattoos, with a foreword by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Nikki Sixx, was released in January 2009 and reached #6 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Von D described the book as \"not an autobiography, you know, 'cause I'm too young to do that. But this is just kind of like a picture-driven outline of my career as an artist. So, you see everything from my drawings when I was six to tattoos that have never before been seen.\" Her second book, The Tattoo Chronicles, an illustrated diary following a year in her life, was released October 26, 2010, and reached #3 on The New York Times \"Hardcover Advice & Misc.\" best-seller list.\nIn 2008, Von D created and launched a make-up line for Sephora. She has released new collections every year and has expanded her line to include fragrances. In 2012, through Sephora, her New American Beauty Art Tour benefitted the Art of Elysium charitable organization. In June 2016, she announced that all products in the line would be reformulated to be vegan. In August 2016, the line released a limited-edition lipstick named Project Chimps, with 20% of sales being donated to Project Chimps, an organization dedicated to providing care for retired research chimpanzees. Her makeup line later became mired in controversy after releasing a lipstick called \"Selektion\". The word \"Selektion\" is considered widely controversial and inappropriate in its native Germany where it was the term used by the Nazis to decide who would be chosen to either be put to work or death upon arrival to the concentration camps. The fallout led to the lipstick being renamed \"Beloved\". This choice is even more controversial with her being implicated in other anti-semitic acts. Von D fell under criticism again when she named a lipstick \"Celebutard\", Sephora quickly pulled the lipstick from their stores and issued an apology.\nVon D is the creator of the MusInk Tattoo Convention and Music Festival, which began in 2008. Musink is an all ages Tattoo, Music, and Art festival located in Southern California.\nOn September 2, 2010, Von D opened the art gallery and boutique Wonderland Gallery in the space next door to High Voltage Tattoo.

The Czech people have been historically characterized as \"tolerant and even indifferent towards religion\".\nChristianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced Catholicism. After the Bohemian Reformation, most Czechs became followers of Jan Hus, Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd and other regional Protestant Reformers. Taborites and Utraquists were major Hussite groups. During the Hussite Wars, Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist\u2014Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in Bohemia by the Catholic Church while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the Reformation, some Bohemians went with the teachings of Martin Luther, especially Sudeten Germans. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly anti-Catholic stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the Habsburgs regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism\u2014even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite Czechoslovak Hussite Church in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing secularization. Protestantism never recovered after the Counter-Reformation was introduced by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1620.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was Protestant (0.5% Czech Brethren and 0.4% Hussite), and 9% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are Pagan). 45% of the population did not answer the question about religion. From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Catholicism decreased from 39% to 27% and then to 10%; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2% and then to 0.8%. The Muslim population is estimated to be 20,000 representing 0.2% of the Czech population.", "Giovanni Antonio Sogliani (1492 \u2013 17 July 1544) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, active mainly in Florence.\nGiorgio Vasari in his Vite, the main source of Sogliani's biography, claimed that the painter had apprenticed with Lorenzo di Credi for two decades. While impossible, the legend rings true because of the persistence an archaic style in Sogliani's paintings. He was the executor of Lorenzo's will in 1531. He painted a Martyrdom of St Acasio for the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence. Vasari claims that Sogliani was influenced by Fra Bartolomeo in this painting. He painted a St Martin for the Orsanmichele. He painted an altarpiece of St Brigitta now in the Museo di San Marco. He also painted a number of works for the Cathedral of Pisa, a commission that had previously been requested from Perino del Vaga. This included three canvases for the Sacrifice of Abel, Sacrifice of Cain, and Sacrifice of Noah completed by 15 May 1533. On 23 March 1536, he was commissioned an altarpiece of the Virgin with child and Saints. \nHe painted an Allegory of the Immaculate Conception now in the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence. Among his pupils are Sigismondo Foschi and Zanobi di Poggino.", "General Sir Sam Browne  was a 19th-century British Indian Army officer who had lost his left arm to a sword cut during the Sepoy Rebellion; this made it difficult for him to draw his sword, because the left hand was typically used to steady the scabbard while the right drew out the sword.\nBrowne came up with the idea of wearing a second belt which went over his right shoulder to hold the scabbard steady. This would hook into a waist belt with D-rings for attaching accessories. It also securely carried a pistol in a flap-holster on his right hip and included a binocular case with a neck-strap. Other officers began wearing a similar rig and eventually it became part of the standard uniform. During the Boer War, it was copied by other troops and eventually became standard issue.\nInfantry officers wore a variant that used two suspender-like straps instead of the cross-belt. It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, of the 60th Rifles, while serving in India.", "Altstadt Spandau is a station in the Spandau district of Berlin, on that city's U-Bahn line . It takes its name from the Altstadt Spandau, the historic central area of the former independent city of Spandau.\nThe station was opened on 1 October 1984 (architect R.G.R\u00fcmmler) with the line's extension from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau. It lies between Rathaus Spandau and Zitadelle stations.\nThe next station is Zitadelle.\nThe station was, like many subway stations at that time, very elaborately and magnificently designed by Rainer G.

Offered a job with a lumber company, and a C$1,000 bonus to play hockey for the Thistles, he stayed in the city, much to the disappointment of the Marlboros, who had wanted him to stay in Toronto. Rat Portage was amalgamated with neighbouring towns in 1905 and was renamed Kenora. Due to their proximity to Manitoba, the Thistles played in the Manitoba Hockey League. In the 1904\u201305 season Phillips had the second-most goals on the team and in the league, with twenty-six, two fewer than Billy McGimsie. The Thistles won the Manitoba league championship, allowing them to challenge for the Stanley, held at the time by the Ottawa Senators. By this time Phillips was regarded as one of the best players in Canada, equal to Frank McGee of the Senators. The Montreal Herald reported that \"nine out of ten people will reply that either Frank McGee or Tom Phillips is\" the best player in the country. In the first game of the challenge series against Ottawa, Phillips scored the first two goals, then added another three in the second half of the game as the Thistles won by a score of 9\u20133. Ottawa won the second game, 4\u20132, while Phillips was held pointless. In the third and deciding game of the series, Phillips scored a hat trick, including the first of the game, although Ottawa won the game 5\u20134 to retain the Cup.\nThe Thistles won the Stirling Cup as champions of western Canada in the 1905\u201306 season, which allowed them the right to challenge for the Cup again, since won by the Montreal Wanderers. There was an early spring that year, and with natural ice used at the time, the series had to wait until the following winter. In the 1906\u201307 season, Phillips led the league in goals, with eighteen. In the first game of the Thistles' successful two-game, total-goal Stanley Cup challenge against the Wanderers in January 1907, Phillips scored all four goals in the Thistles' 4\u20132 victory; he followed that up with three goals in the second game, an 8\u20136 victory, giving the Thistles a 12\u20136 win. A two-game rematch two months later saw the team lose; Phillips' nine goals, and sixteen penalty minutes led both categories.\nPrior to the start of the 1907\u201308 season, he was offered between $1,500 and $1,800 to play for the Wanderers, but instead signed with the Ottawa Senators for a salary of $1,500. Phillips explained that he was ready to sign with the Wanderers, but the contract he received did not include everything promised. In signing with Ottawa, Philips rejoined Harry Westwick and Alf Smith, who had both joined the Thistles for their Stanley Cup defence in March 1907. It also likely made him the highest paid hockey player in Canada. He finished the season with twenty-six goals, two behind the scoring leaders, his teammate Marty Walsh and Russell Bowie of the Victorias.", "The list is compiled from chapter 5 of the 2019 Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES).", "Military Medal of Honor of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico\n Puerto Rico Medal for Distinguished Service\n Puerto Rico Medal of Valor\n Puerto Rico Merit Cross\n Puerto Rico Wounded in Action Medal\n Order of the Governor of Puerto Rico Common Defense Service Medal\n Puerto Rico Combat Service Medal\n Puerto Rico Commendation Medal\n Puerto Rico Outstanding Soldier/NCO of the Year Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Service Medal\n Puerto Rico Exemplary Conduct Ribbon\n Puerto Rico War Service Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Disaster Relief Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Hurricane Georges Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Active Duty for Training Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Caribbean Emergency Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Civil Disturbance Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Law Enforcement Ribbon\n Puerto Rico VIII Pan-American Games Support Ribbon\n Puerto Rico English Language Proficiency Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Counterdrug Service Ribbon\n Puerto Rico 1992 Regatta Ribbon\n Puerto Rico Community Service Ribbon", "Serbia became an independent state on 5 June 2006.\n\u00a0Democratic Party (1)\n\u00a0Socialist Party (1)\n\u00a0Serbian Progressive Party (2)", "Diamond Head appears on an 80-cent air mail stamp issued in 1952 to pay for shipping orchids to the mainland of the U.S.\nA 1975 televised game show, The Diamond Head Game was set at Diamond Head.\nThe Crater was the location of several concerts in the 1960s and 1970s.

It is endemic to the Schouten Islands off West Papua, in Indonesia, an important area of bird endemism. The species was once treated as part of a superspecies with the shining starling. There are two subspecies, the nominate race, which occurs on Biak, and brevicauda, which is found on Numfor Island. It occurs in a wide range of habitats at all altitudes, including natural forest and forest edges, as well as human modified secondary forests and gardens. In spite of its tiny global range the species is not considered threatened by human activities and remains common within its range, and is therefore listed as least concern by the IUCN.\nThe long-tailed starling is a large starling, ranging from 28\u00a0to 41\u00a0cm (11\u201316\u00a0in) in length, including the tail. There are no differences between the sexes. The tail is very long, as long or longer than the body in the nominate race, although in the race brevicauda it is only two-thirds as long as the body. In the wild they cock and fan these large tails. The plumage of this species is black with an oily green gloss over the body, although the subspecies brevicauda is less glossy than the nominate. The gloss on the head is bronze coloured and the feathers of the fore-head are bristled. The feet and bill are black, and the iris is brown.\nLittle is known about the biology of this species. They are conspicuous birds, sitting in prominent open perches in trees in a manner reminiscent of a drongo. Its calls have been described as a series of loud warbles, and it also gives a descending slurred \"cheeeuw\". The species occurs in small groups or in pairs, foraging for fruit in trees and in the undergrowth.

To support these operations four large hangars were built as well as support buildings including a hospital and control tower.\nAfter the war (1947) the airport was transferred to the Canadian Department of Transport for civilian use. That year Trans-Canada Air Lines, now known as Air Canada, started providing passenger service using DC-3 aircraft.\nAir Canada in 1950 began operating the Canadair North Star at the airport, followed by the Vickers Viscount in 1955. A new terminal building was also constructed in 1955 by Transport Department architects.\nThe primary runway (09/27) was lengthened in 1954 and again in 1960 to 8,300\u00a0ft (2,530\u00a0m). The secondary runway (15/33) was lengthened in 1963 to 6,200\u00a0ft (1,890\u00a0m).\nFrom 1950-78 the Airport was again made a station of the RCAF. The station was named RCAF Station Saskatoon.\nOn January 1, 1971, the City of Saskatoon annexed the airport and surrounding lands totalling 2,111.7 acres. The nearby area containing personnel housing and support services was annexed by the city in 1965.\nDue to larger aircraft and more frequent flights, in 1972 plans were drafted for a new terminal building. The new terminal built by Holiday and Scott was completed and opened on November 29, 1975. The former terminal was renovated in 1977. From 1977 to 1984 Boeing 747 charter flights were operated by Wardair to Europe until Wardair was bought by Canadian Airlines International.\nIn 1993 the name of the airport was changed to recognize Canada's 13th Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In 1995 under the Canada-US Open Skies agreement Northwest Airlines started service to Minneapolis \u2013 Saint Paul. In 1996 WestJet began Boeing 737 service. In 1999 the airport was turned over to the Saskatoon Airport Authority (now known as Skyxe), as part of the National Airports Policy.\nIn 2000, Nav Canada constructed a new control tower and the airport authority began renovations and expansions to the terminal building. In October 2002 the first two phases of renovations to the air terminal building was completed at a cost of $18 million. The updated terminal facilities are designed to handle 1.4 million passengers annually was designed by Kindrachuk Agrey Architects. In 2005 additional renovations were completed to the check-in area and baggage screening as well as the addition of a fifth bridge. In 2006 the airport also expanded public parking to 500 stalls. In March 2008 work started on the rehabilitation of runway 09/27, taxiway Foxtrot and Alpha at a cost of $16 million.\nBetween October, 2005 and May 2008 Air Canada ended \"mainline\" service into Saskatoon, turning over routes to Air Canada Jazz. In 2006, Pronto Airways started operating at the airport. In 2006 Transwest Air introduced service to Fort McMurray, Alberta. For a short period of time between 2006 and April 2007 Northwestern Air also operated flights to Fort McMurray. In 2008, United Airlines began non-stop regional service from Denver that operated until 2015. In 2009, United Airlines announced regional service from Chicago that operated until 2014.\nIn March 2015, Missinippi Airways began thrice-weekly service to Saskatoon direct to Flin Flon, Manitoba with a one-stop connection to The Pas, Manitoba. Missinippi Airways ceased flying out of Saskatoon three months later.  In June, 2016,  New Leaf Airlines announced they would begin flying to Kelowna and Hamilton direct from Saskatoon twice weekly beginning July 27, 2016.

Originally, the school was to be called \"Impact Wrestling\" (not to be confused with the later promotion of the same name), but when Montoya decided not to put up money for its foundation and left the project, Carter and Quackenbush decided they needed a new name. The Wrestle Factory was founded by Carter and Quackenbush in Allentown, Pennsylvania on January 7, 2002. The first class included UltraMantis, Mister Zero, Dragonfly, Hallowicked, and Ichabod Slayne. In May of the same year, Chikara expanded into a wrestling promotion with the intent of showcasing its students. The first show on May 25, 2002, featured not only the Wrestle Factory students and head trainers, but several other independent wrestlers, including Don Montoya, CM Punk, Colt Cabana, Chris Hero, Love Bug, Marshal Law, and Blind Rage. The main event of the first show featured Quackenbush and Youth joined by Don Montoya as the Black T-shirt Squad defeat the Gold Bond Mafia of Chris Hero, CM Punk, and Colt Cabana. In the early days, Blind Rage, Hallowicked, and Ichabod Slayne formed a stable known as the Night Shift, which became the top group of rudos (or heels) in the promotion. They frequently feuded with tecnicos (faces) Quackenbush, Youth, and UltraMantis. Notable events of 2002 included an appearance by former World Championship Wrestling star La Parka, who joined Mister Zero against Quackenbush and Youth, and the opening of the short-lived sister promotion Kiryoku Pro, which highlighted female wrestling.\n2002 was also marked by a lawsuit against Chikara for promoting shows at the Wrestle Factory. Neighborhood activists claimed that the building was not properly zoned for assembly, and that the shows detracted from the \"complexion of the community\". It was eventually ruled that Chikara provided inadequate parking for their shows, and would not be allowed to promote out of the Wrestle Factory any longer. This deterred Chikara from holding any more shows until October. During the Chikara hiatus, they released tapes of their early shows, titled \"The Renaissance Dawns\" and \"Baila, Parka, Baila\", and the wrestlers worked showcase matches in other promotions, such as IWA Mid-South. Chikara soon reached an agreement with St. John\u2019s Lutheran Church in Allentown to hold shows there, only eight blocks from the Wrestle Factory. Chikara also began a second Wrestle Factory class, but lost trainer Reckless Youth at the beginning of the class, as he left the wrestling business. The first show in St. John's saw the Wildcards (Eddie Kingston and BlackJack Marciano), Gran Akuma, DJ Skittlez, Melvin Snodgrass and Lester Crabtree debut, and shortly after, they were joined by Wrestle Factory graduates Jigsaw and Bryce Remsburg. Soon after Chikara debuted the Young Lions Cup tournament, a concept still used by the promotion. Commonly abbreviated as the YLC, the tournament was designed to showcase the best of the Wrestle Factory graduates. Hallowicked defeated Mister Zero to win the inaugural tournament, becoming the first-ever Young Lions Cup Champion in the process. In December 2002, Chikara took a two-week break during Christmastime before returning in 2003, establishing a tradition of \"seasons\" that they maintain today.\nIn 2004, Chris Hero became a co-trainer at the Chikara Wrestle Factory, replacing Carter. In 2005, Jorge \"Skayde\" Rivera joined as the third trainer. In March 2005, the school moved from Allentown to the New Alhambra Arena, in Philadelphia. They then took over the training for Combat Zone Wrestling, leading to the school's new name of CZW/Chikara Wrestle Factory. After the schools split in 2007, the training center became once again simply known as the Chikara Wrestle Factory. In 2007, Claudio Castagnoli took over Chris Hero's training duties.\nOn March 2, 2008, Chika", "A common belief related to catholicity is institutional continuity with the early Christian church founded by Jesus Christ. Many churches or communions of churches identify singularly or collectively as the authentic church. The following summarizes the major schisms and conflicts within Christianity, particularly within groups that identify as Catholic; there are several competing historical interpretations as to which groups entered into schism with the original early church.\nAccording to the theory of Pentarchy, the early undivided church came to be organized under the three patriarchs of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch, to which later were added the patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem. The Bishop of Rome was at that time recognized as first among them, as is stated, for instance, in canon 3 of the First Council of Constantinople (381)\u2014many interpret \"first\" as meaning here first among equals\u2014and doctrinal or procedural disputes were often referred to Rome, as when, on appeal by Athanasius against the decision of the Council of Tyre (335), Pope Julius I, who spoke of such appeals as customary, annulled the action of that council and restored Athanasius and Marcellus of Ancyra to their sees. The Bishop of Rome was also considered to have the right to convene ecumenical councils. When the Imperial capital moved to Constantinople, Rome's influence was sometimes challenged. Nonetheless, Rome claimed special authority because of its connection to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who, many believe, were martyred and buried in Rome, and because the Bishop of Rome saw himself as the successor of Saint Peter. There are sources that support the fact that Peter was not the first Pope and never went to Rome.\nThe 431 Council of Ephesus, the third ecumenical council, was chiefly concerned with Nestorianism, which emphasized the distinction between the humanity and divinity of Jesus and taught that, in giving birth to Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary could not be spoken of as giving birth to God. This Council rejected Nestorianism and affirmed that, as humanity and divinity are inseparable in the one person of Jesus Christ, his mother, the Virgin Mary, is thus Theotokos, God-bearer, Mother of God. The first great rupture in the Church followed this Council. Those who refused to accept the Council's ruling were largely Persian and are represented today by the Assyrian Church of the East and related Churches, which, however, do not now hold a \"Nestorian\" theology. They are often called Ancient Oriental Churches.\nThe next major break was after the Council of Chalcedon (451). This Council repudiated Eutychian Monophysitism which stated that the divine nature completely subsumed the human nature in Christ. This Council declared that Christ, though one person, exhibited two natures \"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation\" and thus is both fully God and fully human. The Alexandrian Church rejected the terms adopted by this Council, and the Christian Churches that follow the tradition of non-acceptance of the Council\u2014they are not Monophysite in doctrine\u2014are referred to as Pre-Chalcedonian or Oriental Orthodox Churches.\nThe next great rift within Christianity was in the 11th century. Longstanding doctrinal disputes, as well as conflicts between methods of Church government, and the evolution of separate rites and practices, precipitated a split in 1054 that divided the Church, this time between a \"West\" and an \"East\". Spain, England, France, the Holy Roman Empire, Poland, Bohemia, Slovakia, Scandinavia, the Baltic states, and Western Europe in general were in the Western camp, and Greece, Romania, Russia and many other Slavic lands, Anatolia, and the Christians in Syria and Egypt who accepted the Council of Chalcedon made up the Eastern camp. This division between the Western Church and the Eastern Church is called the East\u2013West Schism.\nIn 1438, the Council of Florence convened, which featured a strong dialogue focussed on understanding the theological differences between the East and West, with the hope of reuni", "Mohammad Mayeli Kohan (Persian: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u0647\u0646\u200e, born 5 June 1953) is a retired Iranian football player and a current coach.

However, in Vaivahika section of Adi Parva Vyasa describes her as the celestial Sri. In Svargarohanika Parva, Yudhisthira goes to heaven and sees Draupadi seated as Goddess Sri (Or Sree).\nIn living traditions, however, Draupadi is seen more often as an incarnation of Adi Shakti and Goddess Kali. The Draupadi Amman sect (or Draupadi devotional sect) is a tradition that binds together a community of people in worshipping Draupadi Amman as a village goddess with unique rituals and mythologies. The sect believes that Draupadi is the incarnation of goddess Kali. Fire walking or Thimithi is a popular ritual enacted at Draupadi Amman temples. At the ancient religious festival of Bengaluru Pete named Bangalore Karaga, Draupadi is worshipped as an incarnation of Adishakti and Parvati in the nine-day event.\nThere are over 400 temples dedicated to Draupadi in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and other countries like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, R\u00e9union, South Africa.

The Sed festival, for example, celebrated the thirtieth year of an Egyptian pharaoh's rule and then every three (or four in one case) years after that.

He joined the right-wing Fatherland League organisation upon his return to Norway in 1929, and he became a popular speaker at public rallies. His provocative style however often led to controversies. Although his agitation was chiefly directed against the political left, he also rejected the efforts of the far-right.

He was initially blocked from entering the organised Norwegian resistance during the Second World War, but nonetheless did work to assist resistance members, and he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned twice.\nAfter the war, Lange initially focused on his work as a kennel-owner, as well as to write and publish his own dog-owner's paper. Although he had pledged to not enter politics again, he became increasingly politically active. He started touring the country to speak at his public rallies, and the paper he published became increasingly political.

H. Barrows when he was fourteen. On January 29, 1877, Burnham married Adelia S. Milliken. After the marriage, the couple would move to San Francisco, where Burnham planned to open a new practice. One of his commissions, with Chicago architect Willoughby J. Edbrooke, was for the Wesley Avenue School at the University of Notre Dame in 1879. Burnham's first son, John Paul, was born in 1883.\nAt some point around 1887, the Burnhams returned to Chicago. He established a working relationship with Edbrooke in the Chamber of Commerce Building. Burnham was the chief designer while Edbrooke oversaw general management. They designed residences in Evanston, Chicago, and Kansas City. They were also commissioned by YMCA to design a building in Atlanta for $100,000. It was in Atlanta that Edbrooke & Burnham would receive their most notable commission a few years later\u2014the Georgia State Capitol. A national competition was held for the building, which had to only use materials from Georgia. The Renaissance and Classical Revival design submitted by Edbrooke & Burnham was announced as the winner, and the cornerstone was dedicated on September 2, 1885. The building would be completed in June 1889 for $998,157, in line with the $1 million budget. In 1974, the Georgia State Capitol would become the forty-third National Historic Landmark in the state.

He designed several residences, a train station, and a church for the town. The Mr. J. William de Coursey O'Grady House at 149 Kenilworth Avenue would be listed on the NRHP in 2008. Burnham himself lived in one of his Kenilworth houses at 37 Kenilworth Avenue.\nBurnham assumed all responsibility for the practice after Edbrooke was appointed Supervising Architect of the Treasury in 1891. In 1892, the firm designed the Kane County Courthouse in Geneva, Illinois. One of the pair's last major commissions was for the Mecca Flats in Chicago. The apartment building held almost five hundred residents, and was designed in an unusual U-shape that allowed for a central courtyard. This courtyard design would become the template for Chicago apartment design over the next few decades. Burnham contributed the Cold Storage Warehouse for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The partnership officially ended upon the death of Edbrooke in 1896. Burnham returned to California in 1898 to again open an independent practice.\nBack in California, Burnham focused his practice on designing Carnegie libraries. He designed twelve libraries: nine on his own, and three as part of the firm of Burnham & Bliesner. Only three are still standing, two of which are recognized by the NRHP. The library in Oxnard, now the Carnegie Art Museum, was listed in 1971. The Carnegie Public Library Building in Colton was listed in 1988. Burnham was also commissioned to design the Riverside County Courthouse in Riverside in 1903. He designed San Diego's first skyscraper, the twelve-story First National Bank of San Diego, in 1909. One of his last commissions was the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Pasadena.\nFranklin Pierce Burnham died suddenly in California on December 16, 1909, while visiting a bank. At the time, he resided at 1945 La France Street in South Pasadena.", "The 6th MRC, then as the 10th Military Region Command (Komando Daerah Militer X)  holding the Lambung Mangkurat honorific was activated on 19 July 1958 with the headquarters in Banjarmasin and serving South and Central Kalimantan, while the 9th MRC (Komando Daerah Militer IX), holding the Mulawarman honorific, was based in Samarinda and with East Kalimantan as its AOR. Both formations were raised in response to the threat faced by the Permesta revolt the same year as they split from the then 6th Territorial Army (established 1950 on the basis of the Lambung Mangkurat Infantry Division, formerly the 4th Naval Division of the Indonesian Navy established in 1949). This format lasted until the 1984 reorganization of military regions by the Commander of the National Armed Forces, when the 6th MRC was granted the Tanjungpura honorific when it merged with the 10th and 9th MRCs with a new garrison in Balikpapan. In 2010, the INAF split its military region command for Indonesian parts of Borneo into two, thus the 6th MRC, now with a smaller AOR including North, East and South Kalimantan and with its garrison still in Balikpapan, was granted the Mulawaman honorific title.", "Mihara (\u4e09\u539f\u5e02, Mihara-shi) is a city located in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.

Founder Mort Feldman, an apparel manufacturer from Chicago, flew to the Territory of Hawaii in 1953 on Pan American's China Clipper, intending to retire.   He established the company in 1956.   With partners Janice Moody, formerly a sportswear designer for Catalina, and Mitsue Aka, Moody's pattern maker, he formed Tori Richard with one sewing machine and practically no capital.  They named the company after Victoria (Tori, Moody's daughter) and Richard, Feldman's oldest son.\nTheir first office, at Pier 7 in Honolulu, was known to have floorboards that became damp from the tide rising in Honolulu Harbor.  Among its early offices were a Quonset hut and the historic Primo Brewery, damaged by fire in 1973 and rebuilt to remain the company headquarters for 17 more years.\nSoon after its 1956 launch, Tori Richard became nationally known for the unfussy silhouettes, bright colors and dramatic prints of the dresses, culottes, beachwear, caftans and lounge wear of its high-fashion resort women's line, made largely of imported European fabrics at the time.  Offices in key mainland markets\u2014New York, California, Florida, Dallas and Chicago\u2014attracted attention from high-end retailers, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Bergdorf Goodman, Gimbel's, I. Magnin, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Best & Co. and Marshall Field.\nIn the 1960s and \u201870s, Fifth Avenue windows and top national fashion magazines featured Tori Richard in features and ads, many of them photographed on location in Hawaii.  As the leisure life was the zeitgeist of the era, the Tori Richard fashions\u2014tunics, harem pants, hostess sets, shifts, caftans, culottes, sarong swimsuits and Capri pants\u2014catered to the cocktail, beach and patio parties that were popular at the time.  The esthetics\u2014streamlined and dramatic\u2014departed from the tropical \u201caloha wear\u201d for which Hawaii was known.  Customers ranged from Lucille Ball to the King of Morocco to department store customers across the country.\nIn 1966, Mort Feldman and a fellow Hawaii fashion executive, Howard Hope, lobbied the Hawaii State Legislature to establish \u201cAloha Friday\u201d as a state-sanctioned island practice.  The effort succeeded, and businesses throughout the state wear aloha attire on Fridays, and, increasingly, on the other days of the week.\nThe company grew during the boom years of Hawaii tourism. From the early 1960s, soon after statehood in 1959 and the introduction of jet travel to Hawaii, fashion emerged as the third largest export of the state, with Tori Richard as one of the biggest fashion exporters.     At the request of a Hawaii retailer named Liberty House, Tori Richard, using prints from its women's line, introduced its men's shirts in 1969.  By the mid-1970s, the men's segment of the business was significant, and today the shirts and resort apparel, some of it avidly collected, are carried in all 50 states.\nCotton lawn, now a staple of the company with its proprietary finish, debuted in the 1970s and became a mainstay of the men's line.\nIn the 1980s, menswear eclipsed women's wear in the Tori Richard line.  In 1983, Mort Feldman retired to New Zealand, to return to the U. S. three years later. His son, Josh, a graduate of Punahou School and the University of California at San Diego, with a degree in art and a degree in political science, dropped his ambitions for law school and joined Tori Richard in 1994.  Under the younger Feldman's leadership, the company grew by over 600 percent.\nUpon his return in 1994, Josh Feldman managed the print and product division of the company. He re-introduced the engineered print to the product line in 1995 and redoubled efforts to identify Tori Richard as a print house.\nIn 2002, the women's line was relaunched, and a year later, the first Tori Richard retail store opened at the Hyatt Regency Waik\u012bk\u012b.  Today there are Tori Richard shops at Ala Moana Center, The Shops at Wailea, Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Hilton Hawaiian Village and Whaler's Village in Ka\u2018anapali.

The book describes her early life as a teenager coming out as a lesbian while attending conservative summer camp. It received strongly favorable reviews and was named a finalist for the 2016 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the Graphic Novel/Comics category. Her follow-up memoir, Lost Soul Be At Peace, published in 2018, explores a period of teen depression and her relationships with her family, notably her father, a federal judge.\nThrash has also written two books in a mystery series for young adults. The first book called Strange Truth (formerly We Know It Was You) was published in 2016 by the Simon Pulse imprint of Simon & Schuster. The sequel, Strange Lies, was published in October 2017.\nThrash currently lives in Greater Boston Massachusetts.  She was a frequent contributor to Rookie, a (now defunct) online magazine for teenage girls.", "Asteroid impact avoidance comprises a number of methods by which near-Earth objects (NEO) could be diverted, preventing destructive impact events.  A sufficiently large impact by an asteroid or other NEOs would cause, depending on its impact location, massive tsunamis or multiple firestorms, and an impact winter caused by the sunlight-blocking effect of placing large quantities of pulverized rock dust, and other debris, into the stratosphere.\nA collision 66 million years ago between the Earth and an object approximately 10 kilometres (6 miles) wide is thought to have produced the Chicxulub crater and the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, widely held responsible for the extinction of most dinosaurs.\nWhile the chances of a major collision are low in the near term, there is a certainty that one will happen eventually unless defensive measures are taken. Astronomical events\u2014such as the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts on Jupiter and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, along with the growing number of objects on the Sentry Risk Table\u2014have drawn renewed attention to such threats.\nIn 2016, a NASA scientist warned that the Earth is unprepared for such an event.  In April 2018, the B612 Foundation reported \"It's 100 percent certain we'll be hit [by a devastating asteroid], but we're not 100 percent sure when.\" Also in 2018, physicist Stephen Hawking, in his final book Brief Answers to the Big Questions, considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet. Several ways of avoiding an asteroid impact have been described. Nonetheless, in March 2019, scientists reported that asteroids may be much more difficult to destroy than thought earlier. In addition, an asteroid may reassemble itself due to gravity after being disrupted.", "Karnali Bridge, the asymmetric, single-tower, cable-stayed bridge is the second longest of its type in Nepal and was built by international collaboration.

Tinne is said to have been beautiful, and she was very clever. She knew several languages and was good at riding horses. She was also brave and firm.\nWith her mother and several scientists, Tinne first travelled down the Nile in 1863. Because of the trip, she gathered lots of scientific information, but  Tinne's mother and two of the scientists died. Later, she prepared another trip across the Sahara. She took two big iron tanks of water. The Muslim people, thinking that the tanks had gold inside, attacked Tinne. They cut her with their swords, cutting off her hand so she could not use her gun.

That same year people first took note of the pub owner J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach who with accomplices would later kill the executor of B\u00f6ckingen. After he had spent some time in the Hohenlohe Plains and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the German Peasants' War was getting into full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn monastery of the Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of rebellious peasants. And even though Johann Lachmann, later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525 in B\u00f6blingen. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525 in Neckargartach and his home town of B\u00f6ckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.\nIn 1528, the replacement of the mayor by Hans Riesser, a Protestant, brought on the previously delayed Reformation and through the efforts of Reformer Lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized. In 1529 the Kilianskirche (church tower of the Kilianskirche) was completed. It was the first important religious building of the Renaissance in Germany. The year 1530 brought about the acceptance of the Augsburg Confession by city council and residents and the Heilbronn Catechism of 1536 is the second oldest catechism in the Protestant Church. In 1538 Heilbronn joined the Schmalkaldic League but by 1546 squabbles between troops of the Schmalkaldic League and those of the Emperor Charles V escalated into battles that were won by the Emperor. As a result, Charles V spent Christmas 1546 in Heilbronn to attend the ensuing criminal proceedings. It is also Charles V who in 1522 changed the charter of the city and this charter survived almost unscathed until 1803.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War the city and surrounding villages suffered badly. After the battle of Wimpfen in 1622, Neckargartach was burnt to the ground. In 1631 Heilbronn was occupied by imperial troops but the same year the Swedes succeeded in conquering the city. From 1644 through 1647, Heilbronn was again part of the Holy Roman Empire, but then French troops moved in and later those of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The city was not free of occupying forces until four years after the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. But already in the 1670s the city again became the stage for armed manoeuvres, until it was occupied by French troops in 1688. But while that occupation of the city only lasted several months, the French were only persuaded to leave the surrounding areas in 1693, after a large defensive army had been put into the field and fortifications had been erected.", "The Egyptian language is conventionally grouped into six major chronological divisions:\nArchaic Egyptian (before 2600 BC), the reconstructed language of the Early Dynastic Period,\nOld Egyptian (c. 2600 \u2013 2000 BC), the language of the Old Kingdom,\nMiddle Egyptian (c. 2000 \u2013 1350 BC), the language of the Middle Kingdom to early New Kingdom and continuing on as a literary language into the 4th century,\nLate Egyptian (c. 1350 \u2013 700 BC), Amarna period to Third Intermediate Period,\nDemotic (c. 700 BC \u2013 AD 400), the vernacular of the Late Period, Ptolemaic and early Roman Egypt,\nCoptic (after c. 200 AD), the vernacular at the time of Christianisation, and liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity.\nOld, Middle, and Late Egyptian were all written using both the hieroglyphic and hieratic scripts. \nDemotic is the name of the script derived from hieratic beginning in the 7th century BC.\nThe Coptic alphabet was derived from the Greek alphabet, with adaptations for Egyptian phonology.

This was also the time she adopted the humorous pseudonym Jonathan Slick.  Over the next few years she wrote over twenty-five serial novels plus short stories and poems for several well known periodicals which included Godey's Lady's Book and Graham's Magazine.

Over the past million years, numerous wolf-like forms existed but their turnover has been high, and modern wolves are not the lineal ancestors of dogs. Although research had suggested that dogs and wolves were genetically very close relatives, later phylogenetic analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that dogs and wolves are reciprocally monophylic taxa that form two sister clades. This suggests that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the wolves that were first domesticated and the wolf ancestor of dogs is therefore presumed extinct. Recent mitochondrial DNA analyses of ancient and modern gray wolf specimens supports a pattern of population reduction and turnover. An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined humans.\nIn 2016, a study investigated for the first time the population subdivisions, demography, and the relationships of gray wolves based on their whole-genome sequences. The study indicated that the dog was a divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct ghost population of Late Pleistocene wolves, and the dog and the dingo are not separate species. The genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated a genetic divergence between New World and Old World wolves, which was then followed by a divergence between the dog and Old World wolves 27,000YBP \u2013 29,000 YBP. The dog forms a sister taxon with Eurasian gray wolves but not North American wolves. The dog had considerable pre-ancestry after its divergence from the Old World wolves before it separated into distinct lineages that are nearly as distinct from one another as they are from wolves. The study suggested that previous datings based on the divergence between wolves and coyotes of one million years ago using fossils of what appeared to be coyote-like specimens may not reflect the ancestry of the modern forms.\nThe study indicated that the Mexican wolf was also a divergent form of gray wolf, suggesting that may have been part of an early invasion into North America. The Tibetan wolf was found to be the most highly divergent of the Old World wolves, had suffered a historical population bottleneck and had only recently recolonized the Tibetan Plateau. Glaciation may have caused its habitat loss, genetic isolation then local adaption.\nThe study indicated that there has been extensive genetic admixture between domestic dogs and wolves, with up to 25% of the genome of Old World wolves showing signs of dog ancestry, possibly as the result of gene flow from dogs into wolves that were ancestral to all modern wolves. There was evidence of significant gene flow between the European wolves plus the Israeli wolf with the basenji and boxer, which suggests admixture between the lineages ancestral to these breeds and wolf populations. For the lowland Asian wolves: the Central Russian and East Russian wolves and all of the lowland Chinese wolves had significant gene flow with the Chinese indigenous dogs, the Tibetan Mastiff and the dingo. For the highland Asian wolves: The Tibetan wolves did not show significant admixture with dogs; however, the Qinghai wolves had gene flow with the dingo and one of them had gene flow with the Chinese dogs. The New World wolves did not show any gene flow with the boxer, dingo or Chinese indigenous dogs but there was indication of gene flow between the Mexican wolf and the African basenji. All species within the genus Canis, the wolf-like canids, are phylogenetically closely related with 78 chromosomes and can potentially interbreed. There was indication of gene flow into the golden jackal from the population ancestral to all wolves and dogs (11.3%\u201313.6%) and much lower rates (up to 2.8%) from extant wolf populations.\nThe data indicated that all wolves shared similar population trajectories, followed by population decline that coincided with the expansion of modern humans worldwide and their technology for capturing large gam", "The Borneo Campaign of 1945 was the last major Allied campaign in the SWPA. In a series of amphibious assaults between 1\u00a0May and 21\u00a0July, the Australian I\u00a0Corps, under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, attacked Japanese forces occupying the island. Allied naval and air forces, centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, 1TAF and the US Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign. The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945. The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July\u00a01945, however, and its decision to not release the 6th\u00a0Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead.\nThe campaign opened on 1 May 1945, when the 26th Brigade Group landed on the small island of Tarakan off the east coast of Borneo. The goal of this operation was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19\u00a0June, and the airstrip was not opened until 28\u00a0June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.\nThe second phase of the Borneo Campaign began on 10 June when the 9th Division conducted simultaneous assaults on the north-west on the island of Labuan and the coast of Brunei. While Brunei was quickly secured, the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week. After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th\u00a0Brigade was landed in North Borneo and the 20th\u00a0Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei. Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance, and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war. During the campaign the 9th\u00a0Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces.\nThe third and final stage of the Borneo Campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of the island. This operation had been opposed by General Blamey, who believed that it was unnecessary, but went ahead on the orders of Macarthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th\u00a0Division landed near the town on 1\u00a0July. Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21\u00a0July, but mopping up continued until the end of the war. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War\u00a0II. Although the Borneo Campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of the lives of soldiers, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.\nAustralia's leadership changed again during the Borneo Campaign. Prime Minister Curtin suffered a heart attack in November\u00a01944, and Deputy Prime Minister Frank Forde acted in his place until 22\u00a0January 1945. Curtin was hospitalised with another bout of illness in April\u00a01945, and Treasurer Ben Chifley became acting Prime Minister as Forde was attending the San Francisco Conference. Curtin died on 5\u00a0July 1945, and Forde was sworn in as Prime Minister. Forde did not have the support of his party, however, and was replaced by Chifley after a leadership ballot was held on 13\u00a0July.", "Red Lobster is a casual dining type of restaurant.

The design was marked by simplicity, as Suzuki strived to return to making a more basic car. The Slide Slim model, with its sliding door on one side, was discontinued, as were some of the higher end versions of the third generation Alto such as the Regina. The new Wagon R took over much of the more expensive Alto's market share, leaving the Alto to compete at the lower end of the market. The fourth generation was generally not exported, with most foreign markets instead receiving Alto-badged versions of the Indian-built Maruti Zen.\nThe 657\u00a0cc (40.1\u00a0cu\u00a0in) F6A engines were joined by a new high-performance 64\u00a0PS (47\u00a0kW) 658\u00a0cc (40.2\u00a0cu\u00a0in) K6A (HA21) for the Works RS/Z model. Front-wheel drive or full-time four-wheel drive were offered, in three- or five-door sedans or as a three-door van. The Works model was also reclassified as a sedan, as many advantages for light commercial cars had vanished. The tailgate and rear doors are still fairly angular, but the front was more rounded than previous models.\nChronology\nIn March 1995, the Alto Sv model appeared. This was a special fuel economy model, well equipped with air conditioning, power steering, AM/FM cassette stereo, etc. The \"Alto With\", a limited sporty edition based on the well-equipped Sf model (also with four-wheel drive) with a front and rear spoiler, appeared in June 1995. In July a version of the Works Turbo ie/s called the Limited appeared; this had special stereo equipment and keyless entry and power locks. It was developed by AddZest (Clarion). In November 1995, the Works model received a new grille and front bumper, with a bigger opening. In May 1996, the l'\u00c8po model appeared, this three or five-door sedan was based on the Se/Le model and was also available with four-wheel drive. This version received full power equipment, remote key entry, distinctly upholstered full fabric seats (rather than the vinyl backed units of the Se/Le), hubcaps and many other amenities.\nThe Works Turbo F Limited ie/s version appeared in November 1996, offering a carbon panel, special alloy wheels, and more spoilers. In April 1997, the range received a facelift with side door impact beams and a new front design, with new marker lights beneath the headlights and a redesigned trunklid. The Alto l'\u00c8po P2 appeared at the same time, using a fuel injected version of the 12-valve engine with 55\u00a0PS (40\u00a0kW) rather than the usual 52\u00a0PS (38\u00a0kW) carburetted unit. All 12-valve models fitted with four-wheel drive and automatic transmission received a 55\u00a0PS (40\u00a0kW) fuel injected version, as was the case since the third generation Alto. The l'\u00c8po models also received a new (optional) airbag. The Works models only received smaller changes at this time, such as white-backed meters in the dashboard. The RS/Z also received 14-inch wheels and fuller equipment. In November 1997, the even better equipped l'\u00c8po Limited model appeared, with a more powerful stereo system including a CD player. In January 1998, the Works Sports Limited model appeared, a Works ie/s with 14-inch wheels and special seats. In May the \"Alto Beam\" special model appeared, with UV reflecting glass and extra large seats.\nIn March 1995, a second iteration of the Works R arrived, again a limited production vehicle with a close-ratio transmission, built for competition purposes. Like the first Works R it was built in less than one-hundred examples, but this one appeared in two series: The Series 2 had sold out by October 1995 and the third series was available from January until September 1998. Unlike the first Works R, this one was a passenger car version (chassis code HB21S) and received the new, lightweight K6A engine. It was lighter than the regular Works RS/R, and the engine was considerably more powerful - although claimed output remained 64\u00a0PS (47\u00a0kW) as per the regulations, torque increased from 10.5 to 11.0\u00a0kgm (at 3500\u00a0rpm for the Series 2, 4000\u00a0rpm for the Series 3).

It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.\nThe Rococo style began in France in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric Style Louis XIV. It was known as the style rocaille, or rocaille style. It soon spread to other parts of Europe, particularly northern Italy, Austria, southern Germany, Central Europe and Russia. It also came to influence the other arts, particularly sculpture, furniture, silverware and glassware, painting, music, and theatre.

The ATC has trackside and trainborne components working together to provide safe train separation by using train detection, localisation, and end of authority protection. It also provides safe train operation and movement by using train speed determination, monitoring, over-speed protection and emergency braking. The safety of alighting and departing passengers will also be provided by using a station interlocking system. The ATO drives the train in automatic mode, providing the traction and braking control demands to the train rolling stock system, adjusts its speed upon approaching the station, and provides the control of opening and closing of train and platform screen doors once the train has stopped at the station. The ATP ensures safe train separation by using the ATP track circuit status and by location determination, monitors the speed of the train to maintain safe braking distance, and initiate emergency braking in the event of overspeed. The MRT also uses an automatic train supervision system to supervise the overall operation of the train service according to a prescribed timetable or train interval.\nThe oldest lines, the North South line and East West line, were the only lines running with fixed block signalling. The North South line was upgraded to moving block CBTC in 2017, and the East West line upgraded in 2018. As of 27 May 2018, all MRT lines use the CBTC Moving Block system in normal daily operations and from 2 January 2019, the old signalling system ceased operations. In comparison to the original fixed block system, the CBTC can reduce train intervals from 120 seconds to 100 seconds, allowing for a 20% increase in capacity and is able to support bidirectional train operations on a single track, enabling trains to be diverted onto another track in the event of a fault on one track. The CBTC system also permits for improved braking performance in wet weather as compared to the original fixed-block ATC.\nAll new MRT lines built since the North East line in 2003 were equipped with CBTC from the outset, and have the capability to be completely driverless and automated, requiring no on-board staffing.

This is due to the relatively stable water supply provided by the two river sources, the Lachlan and the Murrumbidgee.\nPopulations of frogs and other amphibians are often used as bioindicators in wetlands to assess the health of the ecosystem. An assessment of 14 sites along the Cumbung Swamp, and nearby Booligal Wetlands, by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office found 4 species of native frog commonly residing in the area. This included the Barking Marsh Frog, Great Banjo Frog, Spotted Marsh Frog and Eastern Sign Bearing Froglet, all of which were found in areas with sufficient water supplies through the summer breeding months, with the report concluding environmental flows play an important role in \u201cMaintaining large areas of shallow inundated habitat [which] is important for successful frog breeding\u201d.\nOne of the most important feature of the Cumbung Swamp is its function as a habitat for a range of waterbirds and its role as a breeding site for many of these species, described by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office as \u201cone of the most important waterbird breeding areas in eastern Australia\u201d, which is largely due to the extensive reed beds, of which provide suitable nesting sites for such birds. An estimated 131 bird species inhabit the area, many of these being waterbird species which are reliant on the water of the swamps, particularly in times of drought. Examples of waterbird species that are frequently found in the area include the Straw Necked Ibis and Spoonbills as well as Australasian Bittern and Australian Painted-snipe, both of which are on the endangered species list. Maintaining the waterbird population in the Cumbung Swamp is a priority of the management of the swamp and the wider Murray Darling Basin. To \u201cImprove the complexity and health of priority waterbird habitat to maintain species richness and aid future population recovery\u201d was identified as an objective of the 2015-2016 Environmental Water Plan, by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), highlighting the importance of the area in the ensuring the management of waterbird populations.\nBeing a water-based aquatic system, the Cumbung swamp is also home to a range of fish species, with particularly high numbers found in the deeper channels of the system. Native species found in the catchment include Murray Cod, Flat Headed Gudgeon, Australian Smelt and Carp Gudgeon, with introduced species, including the Common Carp, also being found in the area. These fish species are highly vulnerable with many, including the Silver Perch, being placed on the NSW threatened species schedule, which is mainly due to the altercation of river water flows. In order to ensure fish populations are maintained and the health of the ecosystem continues to thrive, there must be sufficient water flows to the swamp, particularly the Lachlan River, to extend the area of the swamp by linking the various intermittent channels.\nAs a water-based ecosystem, the Great Cumbung Swamp is also an important refugee for land-based animals, particularly during times of drought. Common species of mammals found in the area include the Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) and Echidna (Tachyglossidae), with marsupial species such as the Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps) becoming less common in the area, due to habitat destruction\nIntroduced animals, such as the wild pig, have played a further role in habitat destruction, with the establishment of the Western Riverina Pig Program to monitor and control the population throughout the Riverine district including the Cumbung area.", "In the early years of pro wrestling, the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like Miss Elizabeth, Sherri Martel and Woman made their debuts during the 1980s professional wrestling boom and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers.\nUp until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: \"getting heat.\" During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include \"The Mouth of The South\" Jimmy Hart in Memphis, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan in the American Wrestling Association, and the \"Three Wise Men\" (Lou Albano, Freddie Blassie, and The Grand Wizard) in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now the WWE).\nBy the 2000s, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by people who hold on-screen power as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions. However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as Paul Heyman and Vickie Guerrero have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.", "Like most weavers, it is a gregarious bird which forages on the ground for insects, especially beetles and butterflies, fruits, and seeds, often in company with starlings. Foraging is often done in groups of 3\u20136 birds. It has various calls and the sound is sometimes parrot-like: \u201cskwieeer\u201d, \u201ckiiyerr\u201d, a ringing and repetitious \u201ctew\u201d. In addition, variable sounds such as chuckles and whistles can be heard at breeding and roosting sites. The sounds are slow and drawn out. They also make trills: \u201ctsu-weely-weely-wair\u201d. They often perch in trees and hang upside-down and can be very noisy. Breeding and roosting is done in groups and they can be defensive against intruders, usually by making noise. Altercations are rarely fatal and usually vocal. Males display to females by spreading their wings to show their white wing-patches and red-orange tail-coverts.\nBreeding pairs are monogamous and nests are built together. The breeding season is related to rainfall and varies according to local conditions. Nest materials are pushed together, not interwoven, to form an oval 570 millimetres (22\u00a0in) wide. A short entrance tube opens downwards and is about 2\u00a0to 4 metres (6.6\u201313.1\u00a0ft) above the ground. Soft materials line the inner portions of the nest, which usually has several rooms, with defensive thorny branches on the outside. A large tree will have several of their nests, which other birds, such as the African pygmy-falcon, are known to use instead of building their own.

These were particularly popular in the Calvinist tradition, where in the past they were typically sung to the exclusion of hymns. John Calvin himself made some French translations of the Psalms for church usage, but the completed Genevan Psalter eventually used in church services consisted exclusively of translations by Cl\u00e9ment Marot and Th\u00e9odore de B\u00e8ze, on melodies by a number of composers, including Louis Bourgeois and a certain Maistre Pierre. Martin Luther's Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott is based on Psalm 46. Among famous hymn settings of the Psalter were the Scottish Psalter and the paraphrases by Isaac Watts. The first book printed in North America was a collection of Psalm settings, the Bay Psalm Book (1640).\nBy the 20th century, they were mostly replaced by hymns in church services. However, the Psalms are popular for private devotion among many Protestants and still used in many churches for traditional worship. There exists in some circles a custom of reading one Psalm and one chapter of Proverbs a day, corresponding to the day of the month.\nMetrical Psalms are still very popular among many Reformed Churches.", "Already by 1893 two favourable articles about vegetarianism, had appeared in La Esperantisto (\"The Esperantist\") \u2014 both later incorporated into Fundamenta krestomatio (1903), L. L. Zamenhof's basic Esperanto reader: La hejmo de la metiisto (\"The home of the craftsman\") and Kio estas vegetarismo? \"What is vegetarianism?\"). A third example may also be mentioned: an article about the longevity of centenarians, which pointed out that a common factor seemed to be a largely plant-based diet. The publication of such stories and articles suggests that Zamenhof himself had a positive attitude towards vegetarianism.\nOn August 16, 1908, at the Fourth World Congress of Esperanto in Dresden, Germany, the International Union of Esperantist Vegetarians (Internacia Unui\u011do de Esperantistaj Vegetaranoj, IUEV) was founded. Several years later the group changed its name to Vegetarian Esperantist League (Vegetara Ligo Esperantista, VLE). Finally, just after World War II, it adopted its present name, World Esperantist Vegetarian Association (Tutmonda Esperantista Vegetarana Asocio, TEVA).\nThe association was founded at the instigation of Ren\u00e9 de Ladev\u00e8ze. According to the Enciklopedio de Esperanto, Leo Tolstoy (himself a committed vegetarian) agreed to serve as its honorary president. According to Esperantista Vegetarano (1995, p. 23), Ludwik Zamenhof was also among the 19 founding members but requested that this not be mentioned in their vegetarian literature. This information has not been corroborated elsewhere.\nTwo days after the IUEV founding convention, the International Vegetarian Union (IVU) was established, also in Dresden, this latter group intended primarily as an association of those vegetarians who were not also Esperantist. \nJ. Arthur Gill, an Esperanto speaker who was secretary of a Quaker group known as the Friends Vegetarian Society, founded in 1902, had suggested that the vegetarian non-Esperantists could hold their own founding convention in connection with the earlier event and that Esperanto vegetarians could attend both events and help international understanding at the IVU's convention through the neutral medium of Esperanto. In the end, however, only a few Esperantists actually attended the IVU founding convention on August 18, 1908.\nBy the time of its 1913 IVU convention at The Hague, Esperanto was one of the IVU's five official languages, along with English, French, German and Dutch.\nIn 1914 the first issue of the magazine Vegetarano appeared, edited by Esperantist August Oskar B\u00fcnemann (1885\u20131958). From 1927 until 1932, the magazine was both a magazine for Esperantist vegetarians and an official organ of the International Vegetarian Union. In addition to Esperanto-language articles, it contained information about international vegetarianism written in English, French and German. For financial reasons, IVU stopped publishing the magazine in 1932.\nIn 1954, Nathan Ben Zion Havkin, founder of the Palestine-Israel Vegetarian Foundation, reorganized TEVA, which was further reawakened in 1971 by Arno\u0161t V\u00e1\u0148a, of Slovakia (1909-1998). He introduced a principle whereby instead of paying a fixed membership fee, members could individually decide on the amount of their annual donation. TEVA maintained this system until 2008.\nIn 1992 V\u00e1\u0148a was succeeded as president by Christopher Fettes, a Briton who had become an Irish citizen. For a few years a schism resulted, as TEVA had to reconcile inconsistent records of Italian and Slovakian membership numbers and donation receipts, and had also to resolve uncertainty as to who had been chosen as board members to represent those countries. The problems were blamed on the 85-year-old V\u00e1\u0148a, whose health had begun to deteriorate in the last years of his life before he died in 1998. The schism was eventually healed when the membership ended V\u00e1\u0148a's experiment, replacing his leadership through a loose collective of friends with a restored society structure properly governed by its constitution and by-laws through a democratically elected board.\nAmong the above-mentioned activists or supporters, ", "Morphological analysis on its short limbs and the expanded zeugopodia suggested that the species was adapted to near-shore marine environment. Its webbed feet helped for steering through the water. Its slender body and long tail are believed to assist with aquatic locomotion. Judging from its elongated jaws and the many teeth-covered palate, its primary food source was fish.\nTypical features of thalattosaurs are the elongated premaxilla and the relatively large snout, and a small or absent upper temporal fenestra. The cranial reconstruction of Askeptosaurus is consistent with the features previously listed: Askeptosaurus had a very slender and flattened skull. The snout was significantly elongated, the orbits were comparatively large, and the posterior skull table was deeply emarginated. The premaxilla of Askeptosaurus comprises almost half the length of the skull (maximum length is 26\u00a0cm (10.2 inches) among the investigated specimens) and forms more than one-third of the tooth row in the upper jaw. Askeptosaurus also had the following traits differ from the non-askeptosauroid thalattosaurs:\n1. Lack of a fusion between postorbital and postfrontal.\n2. Presence of a homogenous dentition.\n3. Absence of a diastema and palatal dentition.\n4. Presence of low neural spines.\n5. Presence of a slender radius.\nThe vertebrae of Askeptosaurus were amphicoelous with no sign of pachyostosis. Based on observations, Askeptosaurus possessed at least 38 presacral vertebrae, two sacral vertebrae, and more than 60 caudal vertebrae. There is double-headed rib articulation in the cervical region and single-headed articulation in the dorsal area, which gave the estimated number of cervical vertebrae at least 13. Sacral and caudal ribs are all significantly shorter than the dorsal ribs and have holocephalous heads.\nAmong known specimens, the maximum length of the femur is 13.8\u00a0cm (5.4 inches). The distal tarsals have different sizes. The largest element is distal tarsal 4. It articulates with metatarsals 4 and 5 distally, while the remaining distal tarsals meet their respective metatarsals.

In general these isolable hemithioacetals are cyclic, which disfavors dissociation, and can often be further stabilized by the presence of acid. \nAn important class are S-glycosides, such as octylthioglucoside, which are formed by a reaction between thiols and sugars. Other examples include 2-hydroxytetrahydrothiophene and the anti-HIV drug Lamivudine. \nAnother class of isolable hemithioacetals are derived from carbonyl groups that form stable hydrates.

In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder hidden in the text. These claims have been disputed by science historians. In any case, the formula itself is not useful for firearms or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.\nThere is a record of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being discovered in the nineteenth century but the artifact has since been lost. The earliest known European depiction of a gun appeared in 1326 in a manuscript by Walter de Milemete, although not necessarily drawn by him, known as De Nobilitatibus, sapientii et prudentiis regum (Concerning the Majesty, Wisdom, and Prudence of Kings), which displays a gun with a large arrow emerging from it and its user lowering a long stick to ignite the gun through the touchole In the same year, another similar illustration showed a darker gun being set off by a group of knights, which also featured in another work of de Milemete's, De secretis secretorum Aristotelis. On 11 February of that same year, the Signoria of Florence appointed two officers to obtain canones de mettallo and ammunition for the town's defense. In the following year a document from the Turin area recorded a certain amount was paid \"for the making of a certain instrument or device made by Friar Marcello for the projection of pellets of lead.\" A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on Cividale del Friuli, using gunpowder weapons of some sort. The 1320s seem to have been the takeoff point for guns in Europe according to most modern military historians. Scholars suggest that the lack of gunpowder weapons in a well-traveled Venetian's catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in Europe up until this point, further solidifying the 1320 mark, however more evidence in this area may be forthcoming in the future.\nThe oldest extant cannon in Europe is a small bronze example unearthed in Loshult, Scania in southern Sweden. It dates from the early-mid 14th century, and is currently in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.\nEarly cannon in Europe often shot arrows and were known by an assortment of names such as pot-de-fer, tonnoire, ribaldis, and b\u00fcszenpyle. The ribaldis, which shot large arrows and simplistic grapeshot, were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, between 1345 and 1346. The Florentine Giovanni Villani recounts their destructiveness, indicating that by the end of the battle, \"the whole plain was covered by men struck down by arrows and cannon balls.\" Similar cannon were also used at the Siege of Calais (1346\u201347), although it was not until the 1380s that the ribaudekin clearly became mounted on wheels.", "The committee directing the Professional Concerts included Wilhelm Cramer, leader of the orchestra; William Dance, principal second violin; the cellist James Cervetto; and the composer and violinist William Shield.

William Thomas Parke wrote that in 1788 the Professional Concerts \"were allowed to be of the most perfect and gratifying kind, the band being composed of performers of the first talent in the kingdom, and the company of the most elegant description.\"", "The Parliament of Ireland was the legislature of the Lordship of Ireland, and later the Kingdom of Ireland, from 1297 until 1800.  It was modelled on the Parliament of England and from 1537 comprised two chambers: the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Lords were members of the Irish peerage (\u2019lords temporal\u2019) and bishops (\u2019lords spiritual\u2019; after the Reformation, Church of Ireland bishops). The Commons was directly elected, albeit on a very restricted franchise. Parliaments met at various places in Leinster and Munster, but latterly always in Dublin: in Christchurch Cathedral (15th century), Dublin Castle (to 1649), Chichester House (1661\u20131727), the Blue Coat School (1729\u201331), and finally a purpose-built Parliament House on College Green.\nThe main purpose of parliament was to approve taxes that were then levied by and for the Dublin Castle administration. Those who would pay the bulk of taxation, the clergy, merchants and landowners, also comprised the members. Only the \"English of Ireland\" were represented until the first Gaelic lords were summoned during the 16th-century Tudor reconquest.  Under Poynings' Law of 1495, all Acts of Parliament had to be pre-approved by the Irish Privy Council and English Privy Council. Parliament supported the Irish Reformation and Catholics were excluded from membership and voting in penal times. The Constitution of 1782 amended Poynings' Law to allow the Irish Parliament to initiate legislation. In 1793 Catholics were re-enfranchised.\nThe Acts of Union 1800 merged the Kingdom of Ireland and Kingdom of Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The parliament was merged with that of Great Britain; the united Parliament was in effect the British parliament at Westminster enlarged with a subset of the Irish Lords and Commons.", "Drivers' championship standings\n \nManufacturers' championship standings\nNote: Only the first sixteen positions are included for the driver standings.", "Carlon M.

He has also been a researcher, product developer, and spokesman for other supplement companies including LifeVantage, ITV Ventures, Cytodyne Technologies, Muscletech Research and Development, Metabolife International, and Vital Basics.\nIn the early 2000s, Colker was criticized for his research and commentary in relation to dietary supplements including ephedra-based products, amongst others. He was a defendant named in lawsuits filed in multiple U.S. states alleging that research he conducted on behalf of the ephedra supplement manufacturers Cytodyne Technologies and Metabolife was fraudulent; that he had altered test results, and that he had attempted to hide dangerous adverse reactions suffered by research subjects.

The presence of identical or similar taxa in both the tundra of the far north, and high mountain ranges much further south is testament to the similar environmental conditions found in the two locations. Arctic\u2013alpine plants, for instance, must be adapted to the low temperatures, extremes of temperature, strong winds and short growing season; they are therefore typically low-growing and often form mats or cushions to reduce water loss through evapotranspiration.\nIt is often assumed that an organism which currently has an Arctic\u2013alpine distribution was, during colder periods of the Earth's history (such as during the Pleistocene glaciations), widespread across the area between the Arctic and the Alps. This is known from pollen records to be true for Dryas octopetala, for instance. In other cases, the disjunct distribution may be the result of long-distance dispersal.\nExamples of Arctic\u2013alpine plants include:\nArabis alpina\nBetula nana\nDraba incana\nDryas octopetala\nGagea serotina (syn.

Many of these refugees were Cathar credentes who lived in huts and caves outside the castle on the mountain. The initial strategy was to besiege the castle in expectation that water and supplies would run out, a strategy that had worked well for the crusaders before. However, the defenders were well supplied and able to keep their support lines open, being supported by many of the local population; some reinforcements even arrived. Thus eventually it was decided to attack the place directly, a difficult task due to its well protected location high on a massive limestone rock. After many failures, Basque mercenaries were able to secure a location on the eastern side of the summit across a depression which allowed the construction of a catapult. This forced refugees that were living outside the walls of the castle to move inside, making living conditions difficult. Apparently by treachery, a passage was found to get access to the barbican which was conquered in March 1244. The catapult was now moved closer and the living situation inside deteriorated under the day-and-night bombardment. When an attempt by the garrison failed to dislodge the invaders from the barbican, the defenders gave the signal that they had decided to negotiate for surrender.", "The station has three entrances - Entrance A and Entrance B on either side of Jalan  Cheras, and Entrance C at Jalan 3/144A inside Taman Connaught.

Boats could be propelled by the wind by attaching sails to masts set upright in the boat. Manual propulsion could be done in shallow water by punting with a push pole, and in deeper water by paddling with a paddle or rowing with oars. The difference between paddling and rowing is that when rowing the oars have a mechanical connection with the boat, while when paddling the paddles are hand-held with no mechanical connection. Canoes were traditionally paddled, with the paddler facing the bow of the boat. Small boats that use oars are called rowboats, and the rower typically faces the stern.\nAround 4000 B.C., Egyptians were building long narrow boats powered by many oarsmen. Over the next 1,000 years, they made a series of remarkable advances in boat design. They developed cotton-made sails to help their boats go faster with less work. Then they built boats large enough to cross the oceans. These boats had sails and oarsmen, and were used for war and trade. Some ancient vessels were propelled by either oars or sail, depending on the speed and direction of the wind (see trireme and bireme). The Chinese were using sails around 3000 BC, of a type that can still be seen on traditional fishing boats sailing off the coast of Vietnam in Ha Long Bay.\nA jangada is an elegant planked fishing boat used in northern Brazil. It has been claimed the jangada dates back to ancient Greek time.

She repeated what the Court had said in Shaw v. Reno and Miller v. Johnson: Strict scrutiny applies where \"redistricting legislation . . . is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles,\" or where \"race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its district lines,\" and \"the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . . to racial considerations,\".\nThe Court again held that strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race: that strict scrutiny does not apply in all cases of intentional creation of majority-minority districts, such as the compact districts created by a state court in California. But strict scrutiny does apply where race was the predominant factor in drawing district lines and traditional, race-neutral districting principles were subordinated to race.  The Court found evidence that other factors, including incumbent protection, were considered.\nThe State argued, for example, that the bizarre shape of District 30 in Dallas County was explained by the drafters' desire to unite urban communities of interest and that the bizarre shape of all three districts was attributable to the Legislature's efforts to protect incumbents of old districts while designing the new ones. The Supreme Court upheld the district court's finding to the contrary, holding that race was the predominant factor, saying that \"the contours of Congressional District 30 are unexplainable in terms other than race.\"\nIn applying strict scrutiny, the Court again assumed without deciding that complying with \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act was a compelling state interest, but found that the districts were not narrowly tailored to comply with \u00a7 2 because all three districts were bizarrely shaped and far from compact as a result of racial manipulation. To the extent there was political manipulation, race was used as a proxy for political affiliation. It was race that predominated over all other factors.\nJustice O'Connor further noted that: \"[B]izarre shape and noncompactness cause constitutional harm insofar as they convey the message that political identity is, or should be, predominantly racial. . . . [C]utting across pre-existing precinct lines and other natural or traditional divisions, is not merely evidentially significant; it is part of the constitutional problem insofar as it disrupts nonracial bases of identity and thus intensifies the emphasis on race.\"\nThe court pointed out that, if the minority population is not sufficiently compact to draw a compact district, there is no violation of \u00a7 2; if the minority population is sufficiently compact to draw a compact district, nothing in \u00a7 2 requires the creation of a race-based district that is far from compact.\nA \u00a7 2 district that is reasonably compact and regular, taking into account traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries, may pass strict scrutiny without having to defeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts in endless \"beauty contests.\"\nThe Court found that the district lines were not justified as an attempt to remedy the effects of past discrimination, since there was no evidence of present discrimination other than racially polarized voting. Since racially polarized voting only served to make a case for a violation of \u00a7 2, and the plan was not narrowly tailored to remedy a \u00a7 2 violation, the bizarre shapes were not justified.\nThe Court found that creation of District 18, the reconfigured African-American district in the Houston area, was not justified as an attempt to avoid retrogression under \u00a7 5, since it actually increased the African-Am", "Georgia's military is organized into land and air forces.

Laing, Wharton and Down soon won a contract for electrical lighting for the east end of London.\nIn 1894 Laing, Wharton and Down purchased patents and exclusive production rights from the American company, now known as General Electric after Thomson-Houston merged with Edison General Electric Company in 1892. At this stage Laing, Wharton and Down was renamed as British Thomson-Houston and General Electric became the majority owner of the company.\nOnce BTH had the production licences for Thomson-Houston's products it started setting up factories in the English Midlands, with Rugby, Warwickshire chosen as the main location due to its good accessibility by rail and a local coal supply. In 1900 BTH bought Glebe Farm on the west side of Mill Road north of the railway in Rugby for \u00a310,000, from Thos. Hunter & Co., to build their factory on it. The Mill Road factory opened in 1902 and made electric motors and generators. In the same year BTH got a licence to produce the Curtis steam turbine, which became one of the company's major products. In 1905 BTH made its first turbo-alternator and in 1911 got licences for all of General Electric's drawn-wire light bulbs, which it produced under the Mazda trademark.\nFor much of the late 19th century BTH competed for electrical generation and distribution contracts with British Westinghouse, mirroring the same company's battles in the US between their parents, General Electric and Westinghouse.

Historian Attila Zsoldos analyzed the document in detail and revealed the contradictions between archontological data, which still exist despite that historiographical efforts which tried to correct the charter's date to 1183 or 1185. The forgery, which was written in the name of King B\u00e9la III, contains several factual errors, while other dates are incompatible with each other. Job first appeared as Archbishop of Esztergom in 1185 (without the mention of his see). Soon, Job and Adrian were jointly sent to the Kingdom of France as representants of B\u00e9la III, in order to find a bride for the king (whose wife Agnes had died in the year 1184). They negotiated with King Philip II concerning the issue. Finally, B\u00e9la married Henry II's widowed daughter-in-law, Margaret of France, in the summer of 1186. She was the daughter of Louis VII of France and sister of Philip II.\nImmediately after his election, Job strived to strengthen his paramount position within the domestic church hierarchy. Upon his request, Pope Lucius III confirmed all of the privileges and freedoms of the Archdiocese of Esztergom in April 1185. This privileges were confirmed by Pope Celestine III in 1188 and 1191, as well as Pope Innocent III in 1198 too. Pope Celestine stressed the role of the Archbishop of Esztergom as one of the three requirements at the coronation of the Hungarian monarch in his December 1191 charter (the last three coronations were performed by the Archbishop of Kalocsa for various reasons). Around 1188, the St. Adalbert Cathedral burned down. Job decided to rebuild the basilica \"even with greater splendor\" to represent its indispensable role in the Church of Hungary. The new Gothic style cathedral was consecrated in 1196.\nJob was a staunch supporter of the royal authority during B\u00e9la's rule. He was sent to numerous diplomatic missions during his two decades of episcopate. B\u00e9la III and Job welcomed Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor in the summer of 1189 in Esztergom, when German crusaders marched through Hungary into the Third Crusade. Later in that year, Job mediated a peace treaty between his monarch and Casimir II of Poland after their war for the sphere of influence over the Principality of Halych. Job's relationship with the Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Orthodox Church was ambiguous; he escorted B\u00e9la's daughter Margaret to marry to Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos. There Job had a doctrinal dispute with the Emperor, regarding the use of drowned animals and the relationship of the Son and the Holy Spirit, representing the Latin rite viewpoint. The dispute was narrated by a letter of Demetrios Tornikes. Tam\u00e1s Bogyay highlighted there is no sign of hostile tone in the text, reflecting the mutual esteem between Job and Isaac. The historian considers the Emperor acknowledged his theological education and prestige with his participation in the dispute, and Job presumably spoke Greek fluently. Supporting King B\u00e9la, Job had an important role in the canonization of Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary and the spread of his cult since 1192. Alongside his monarch, Job took the cross as a token of his desire to organize a crusade to the Holy Land in 1195. However, he could not fulfill his oath due to B\u00e9la's death on 23 April 1196.\nEmeric succeeded his father, whose whole reign was characterized by his struggles against his rebellious younger brother, Duke Andrew. Initially, Job was considered the king's supporter. For instance, his archdiocese was granted the two-thirds portion of the customs in Esztergom by Emeric in 1198, which was confirmed by Pope Innocent in the next year. Emeric also donated the royal castle of Esztergom to the archdiocese in the same charter, in addition to the customs of Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia) and Szeben (today Sibiu, Romania).\nDuring the last years of Job's episcopate, the tension between the sees Esztergom and Kalocsa over the diverging views in the question of primacy jurisdiction reached its peak, especially when John, a loyal partisan of Emeric ", "The Achaemenid Empire (559 BC\u2013330 BC) was the first of the Persian Empires to rule over significant portions of Greater Iran. The empire possessed a \u201cnational army\u201d of roughly 120.000-150.000 troops, plus several tens of thousands of troops from their allies.\nThe Persian army was divided into regiments of a thousand each, called hazarabam.\nTen hazarabams formed a haivarabam, or division. The best known haivarabam were the Immortals, the King's personal guard division. The smallest unit was the ten man dathaba. Ten dathabas formed the hundred man sataba.\nThe royal army used a system of color uniforms to identify different units. A large variety of colors were used, some of the most common being yellow, purple, and blue. But this system was probably limited to native Persian troops and was not used for their numerous allies.\nThe usual tactic employed by the Persians in the early period of the empire, was to form a shield wall that archers could fire over. These troops (called sparabara, or shield-bearers) were equipped with a large rectangular wicker shield called a spara, and armed with a short spear, measuring around six feet long.\nThough equipped and trained to conduct shock action (hand-to-hand combat with spears, axes and swords), this was a secondary capability and the Persians preferred to maintain their distance from the enemy in order to defeat him with superior missile-power. The bow was the preferred missile-weapon of the Persians. At maximum rate of fire a sparabara haivarabam of 10,000 men could launch approximately 100,000 arrows in a single minute and maintain this rate for a number of minutes. Typically the Persian cavalry would open the battle by harassing the enemy with hit and run attacks - shooting arrows and throwing small javelins - while the Persian sparabara formed up their battle-array. Then the Persian cavalry would move aside and attempt to harass the flanks of the enemy. Defending against the Persian cavalry required the enemy infantry to congregate in dense static formations, which were ideal targets for the Persian archers. Even heavily armoured infantry like the Greek hoplites would suffer heavy casualties in such conditions. Enemy infantry formations that scattered to reduce casualties from the dense volleys of Persian arrows, were exposed to a close-in shock assault by the Persian cavalry. Torn by the dilemma between exposure to a gradual attrition by the arrows or to being overwhelmed by a cavalry charge on their flanks, most armies faced by the Persians succumbed.\nThe major weaknesses of the typical Persian tactics were that proper application of these tactics required:\na) A wide battlefield composed of fairly flat and expansive terrain that would not hinder the rapid movement of massed horses and where the cavalry could conduct proper flanking maneuvers.\nb) Good coordination between the cavalry, infantry, and missile units.\nc) An enemy inferior in mobility.\nd) An enemy lacking a combined-arms military.\nMost Persian failures can be attributed to one or more of these requirements not being met. Thus, the Scythians evaded the Persian army time and again because they were all mounted and conducted only hit-and-run raids on the Persians; at Marathon the Athenians deployed on a rocky mountainous slope and only descended to the plain after the Persian cavalry had reboarded their transport-ships - charging through the arrow-shower to conduct close-combat with spears and swords - a form of combat for which the Athenians were better equipped and better trained; at Thermopylae the Greek army deliberately deployed in a location that negated the Persians ability to use cavalry and missile-power, again forcing them to fight only head-on in close-combat and was forced to retreat only after the Persians were informed of a bypass that enabled them to circumvent this defensive position to defeat the Spartans; at Plataea the Persian attack was poorly coordinated and defeated piecemeal; Alexander the Great's Macedonian army that invaded the Persian empire was composed of a variety of infantry and cavalry ty", "This is a list of eggplant cultivars:\nLao eggplant\nEaster white eggplant\nIndian eggplant\nSantana eggplant\nWhite eggplant - commons:Category:White eggplant\nTango eggplant\nEggplant-related fruits", "Robert Earl Jones (February 3, c. 1910  - September 7, 2006) was an American actor.

While it was a small province, it possessed several well known religious sanctuaries and figured prominently in Eastern Mediterranean trade, particularly the production and trade of Cypriot copper. The island of Cyprus was situated at a strategically important position along Eastern Mediterranean trade routes, and had been controlled by various imperial powers throughout the first millennium BC. including: the Assyrians, Egyptians, Macedonians, and eventually the Romans. Cyprus was annexed by the Romans in 58 BC but control over the island fluctuated between the Romans and the Ptolemaic Empire until 22 BC when Cyprus became an official senatorial province. From the Battle of Actium in 31 BC until the 7th century Cyprus was controlled by the Romans. Cyprus officially became part of the Eastern Roman Empire in 293 AD.\n\nUnder Roman rule, Cyprus was divided into four main districts, Salamis, Paphos, Amathus, and Lapethos. Paphos was the capital of the island throughout the Roman period until Salamis was re-founded as Constantia in 346 AD.

Among other things, the Commission's report laid out a plan for a sweeping mall in the area of L'Enfant's widest \"grand avenue\", which had not yet been constructed. The McMillan Plan has since been instrumental in the further development of Washington, D.C.

At the time, \"Tetrapoda\" referred to any four-limbed vertebrate and \"Ichthyostegalia\" referred to \"primitive\", Ichthyostega-like Devonian members of the category. However, the arrival and popularity of cladistics has altered both of these terms. The cladistic definition of \"tetrapod\" now popular among biologists and paleontologists refers to a clade (relations-based grouping) containing only descendants of the last common ancestor of living tetrapods. While Hynerpeton is a tetrapod in the sense that it is a four-limbed vertebrate, it is not a member of the clade Tetrapoda because its lineage went extinct long before the lineages of modern tetrapods evolved. Likewise, \"Ichthyostegalia\" has been abandoned in the age of cladistics due to being an evolutionary grade leading to true tetrapods, rather than a relations-based clade. The traditional, non-cladistic definition of Tetrapoda, which begins at the earliest limbed vertebrates, corresponds closely to a clade named Stegocephalia, which is defined as all animals more closely related to temnospondyls than to Pandericthys.\nHynerpeton has not been included in many phylogenetic analyses, but those that have included it usually place it as a transitional form on a series of stem-tetrapods leading to Tetrapoda. The shape of the cleithrum and the loss of the postbranchial lamina allow it to be placed higher than Acanthostega (and usually Ichthyostega as well), but the retention of a single-piece endochondral shoulder girdle usually means that it is not placed higher than Tulerpeton.

These were designated as Class 395 units, which are standard gauge with the ability to operate at speeds of up to 225\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph). Southeastern branded these trains as the Javelin, a reference to the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nHitachi gained further ground in the UK market when it was announced that an A-train based design similar to that of the Class 395, initially named the Hitachi Super Express, won the United Kingdom Government's Intercity Express Programme tender to replace InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 sets on the Greater Western and InterCity East Coast franchises. These units were announced to be classified as Class 800 electro-diesel 'bi-mode' units powered by AC overhead wires where available and underfloor diesel generators beyond extents of electrication and the Class 801 electric multiple unit sets powered purely by AC overhead wires. The train specification allows for the conversion of Class 800s to Class 801s, as it is assumed that electrification will continue to expand. The units would form as part of the Hitachi AT300 product, joining the Class 395 in the same family.\nThe choice of Hitachi units was controversial due to the fact that it would see little final manufacturing in the UK over the foreign-owned but domestically manufactured Bombardier option, particularly in the area that would have manufactured, leading to a campaign to reverse the decision. It was, however, economics which became a sticking point with the weight of the design creeping up (though some accused the Department for Transport of producing impossible specification requirements) and reportedly difficult negotiations over the final unit price and production balance between the different power options. The inability or reluctance of the financial markets to provide the necessary capital was the final straw, leading to the announcement in February 2010 of a three-month independent review into the value for money of the programme.\nAfter winning the franchise, Abellio ScotRail announced they would be purchasing Hitachi AT200 trains (designated as Class 385) for their commuter services. \n\nIn March 2015, after the initial order of the Class 800 units, Great Western Railway (or First Great Western as it was at the time) ordered 29 bi-mode Class 802 units which would also join the AT300 product. These units have little difference over the Class 800 units, with the difference being the fact that the 802s have a larger power output to cope with gradients in Devon and Cornwall (enhanced diesel rating) and are also built with larger fuel tanks. Being a bi-mode unit, they will also use overhead electric power between London Paddington and Newbury. Having initially ordered 29 units, it was later announced that there would be an increase of up to 36 units on order. The first of the Class 800s entered service with GWR in October 2017 and the first of the Class 802s entered service with GWR in August 2018, with all of the units being branded as Intercity Express Trains (IET) by GWR.\nThe first unit with London North Eastern Railway (the current holder of the InterCity East Coast franchise, having replaced the previous Virgin Trains East Coast company) entered service in May 2019 after a delay, with their first trains in service being their Class 800s. Their Class 801s entered service afterwards in September 2019. Separately from GWR, these trains are branded as Azuma, which is 'east' in Japanese. \nMany other UK operators have also made a bid for more members of the Hitachi AT300 product family, which include that of TransPennine Express ordering Class 802s (branded as Nova 1) and Hull Trains also ordering Class 802s (branded as Paragon). More AT300 units are also due to enter service with East Midlands Railway (classified as Class 810 units built, though originally thought to be Class 800 & Class 804 units) as well as future operator East Coast ", "From the Eocene epoch onward, the northward movement of Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate and generated the Himalaya Orogenic belt.

The goal is to shift the patient's body weight off the damaged area to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a wedge of the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.\nA model for this is the hinges on a door. When the door is shut, the hinges are flush against the wall. As the door swings open, one side of the door remains pressed against the wall as space opens up on the other side. Removing just a small wedge of bone can \"swing\" the knee open, pressing the healthy tissue together as space opens up between the femur and tibia on the damaged side so that the arthritic surfaces do not rub against each other.\nOsteotomy is also used as an alternative treatment to total knee replacement in younger and active patients. Because prosthetic knees may wear out over time, an osteotomy procedure can enable younger, active osteoarthritis patients to continue using the healthy portion of their knee. The procedure can delay the need for a total knee replacement for up to ten years.", "Samuel Dash (February 27, 1925 \u2013 May 29, 2004), an American lawyer, was chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee during the Watergate scandal.

She is known for a birthday invitation she sent around 100 AD to Sulpicia Lepidina, wife of Flavius Cerialis, commander at Vindolanda. This invitation, written in ink on a thin wooden tablet, was discovered in the 1970s and is probably the best-known item of the Vindolanda Tablets.\nThe first part of the letter was written in formal style in a professional hand evidently by a scribe; the last four lines are added in a different handwriting, thought to be Claudia's own. \nThe translation is as follows:\nClaudia Severa to her Lepidina greetings.\nOn 11 September, sister, for the day of the celebration of my birthday, I give you a warm invitation to make sure that you come to us, to make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival, if you are present. Give my greetings to your Cerialis. My Aelius and my little son send him their greetings.\n(2nd hand) I shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul, as I hope to prosper, and hail.\n(Back, 1st hand) To Sulpicia Lepidina, (wife) of Cerialis, from Cl. Severa.\" \nThe Latin reads as follows:\nCl.

These two letters are thought to be the oldest extant writing by a woman in Latin found in Britain, or perhaps anywhere. The letters show that correspondence between the two women was frequent and routine, and that they were in the habit of visiting one another, although it is not known at which fort Severa lived.\nThere are several aspects of Severa's letters that should be regarded as literary, even though they were not written for a wide readership. In particular, they share several thematic and stylistic features with other surviving writings in Latin by women from Greek and Roman antiquity. Although Severa's name reveals that she is unlikely to be related to Sulpicia Lepidina, she refers frequently to Lepidina as her sister, and uses the word iucundus to evoke a strong and sensual sense of the pleasure Lepidina's presence would bring, creating a sense of affection through her choice of language. In the post-script written in her own hand, she appears to draw on another Latin, literary model, from the fourth book of the Aeneid, in which at 4.8 Vergil characterises Anna as Dido's unanimam sororem, \"sister sharing a soul\", and at 4.31, she is \"cherished more than life\" (luce magis dilecta sorori). Although this is not proof that Severa and Lepidina were familiar with Virgil's writing, another letter in the archive, written between two men, directly quotes a line from the Aeneid, suggesting that the sentiments and language Sulpicia used do indeed draw on a Virgilian influence.\nThe Latin word that was chosen to describe the birthday festivities, sollemnis, is also noteworthy, as it means \"ceremonial, solemn, performed in accordance with the forms of religion\", and suggests that Severa has invited Lepidina to what was an important annual religious occasion.", "Hernesaari (Finnish), \u00c4rtholmen (Swedish) (until 2013 Munkkisaari / Munkholmen) is a quarter in Helsinki, Finland.", "K.

Also, the car height can be increased by using a button, increasing ground clearance (3 settings) for driving on difficult terrain, lowers automatically at higher speeds.\nFrom 1999 through 2003, the V12-equipped cars featured a cylinder deactivation system called Active Cylinder Control. The feature was dropped when the 500\u00a0PS (368\u00a0kW; 493\u00a0hp) bi-turbo V12 was introduced. This disactivation feature allowed the CL 600 to get better fuel economy than the comparable CL 500 (when not equipped with ACC itself, an option for the V8), especially on the road where the six-cylinder operation could be effectively used.

At the time, this Middle Eastern route was already becoming a standard ingredient of any excursion into foreign lands, a hike that was almost not worth writing home about. However, from there the Italian 'tourist' would take less traveled paths. After crossing Armenia and Persia, he visited Southern India and entered China, where the Jesuit missionaries assumed that such an unusual Italian visitor could be a spy working for the pope. This fortuitous misunderstanding opened for Gemelli many of the most tightly closed doors of the country. He got to visit the emperor at Beijing, attended the Lantern Festival celebrations and toured the Great Wall.\n\"Almost all the structure, as has been said, is of brick, so well built that it does not only last but looks new after several ages.  It is above 1800 years since the Emperor Xi-hoam-ti caused it to be built against the incursions of the Tartars.  This was one of the greatest, and most extravagant works that ever was undertaken. In prudence the Chinese should have secured the most dangerous passes:  But what I thought most ridiculous was to see the wall run up to the top of a vast high and steep mountain, where the Birds would hardly build much less the Tartar horses climb... And if they conceited those people could make their way climbing the clefts and rocks it was certainly a great folly to believe their fury could be stopped by so low a wall.\"\nFrom Macau, Gemelli Careri sailed to the Philippines, where he stayed two months while waiting for the departure of a Manila galleon, for which he carried quicksilver, for a 300% profit in Mexico. In the meantime, as Gemelli described it in his journal, the half-year-long transoceanic trip to Acapulco was a nightmare plagued with bad food, epidemic outbursts, and the occasional storm. In Mexico, he became friends with Mexican creole patriot and savant Don Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora, who took the Italian traveler to the great ruins of Teotihuacan. Sig\u00fcenza spoke with Gemelli about his theories of the ancient Mexicans and entrusted him with information about the Mexican calendar, which appeared in Gemelli's account.  As well as having visited the pyramids at Teotihuacan, he also visited several mining towns. After leaving Mexico city he visited the city of Puebla de Los Angeles and several towns as he traveled to the port city of Veracruz, where he joined a Spanish fleet to Cuba. After five years of wandering around the world, Gemelli was finally on his way back to Europe when he joined the Spanish treasure fleet in Cuba.", "Tsumago contains a number of interesting properties, including:\nTsumago-juku's former honjin and Okuya, the waki-honjin, are both open to visitors today. The honjin, which was the main inn of the post town, was originally destroyed, but it was rebuilt in 1995. The original building of the waki-honjin, which was the secondary inn, however, still remains and was named an Important Cultural Property in 2001.\nThe Nagiso Museum of History (\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u9928) contains information on the areas history, the preservation of row houses and data about row houses throughout the country.\nKabuto Kannon Shrine (\u304b\u3076\u3068\u89b3\u97f3) is a small shrine dedicated to Minamoto no Yoshinaka, the \"General of the Rising Sun,\" who built a citadel at Tsumago. The shrine was built around 1180.\nTsumago Castle (\u59bb\u7c60\u57ce) is nothing but a few ruins today. During the Edo period, however, its mountaintop location gave it wonderful views of both Tsumago-juku and Midono-juku. It served as the site of a large battle in 1584 and was dismantled in the early 17th century, as a result of the Genna era's \"one country, one castle\" rule.\nRurisan K\u014dtoku-ji Temple (\u5149\u5fb3\u5bfa), with its white walls and stone base, rises one story above the area's buildings. Founded in 1500, its main deity was added in 1599, and is notable for its Nightingale floors and a 500-year-old weeping cherry tree out front.\nPerhaps its most interesting aspect, however, is the restored row of houses along the former post road. Most were houses built for common people in the mid-18th century, with shops and inns for travelers along the Nakasend\u014d.\nA quiet portion of the original highway has been preserved between Tsumago and Magome, the next post town (also restored). It provides for a pleasant walk through the forests and past a waterfall. Also, so guests do not have to walk the path twice to return to the beginning of the hike, bus service is provided between the two ends of the road.", "In the fall of 1970, a more luxurious version was added called Comodoro, reflecting Europe's Opel Commodore. The Comodoro-4 received a somewhat more powerful version of the 2.5 liter four cylinder engine in some model years, with 88\u00a0PS (65\u00a0kW; 87\u00a0hp) rather than 80\u00a0PS (59\u00a0kW; 79\u00a0hp). The same engine was used in the Opala SS-4. Even more luxurious was the Diplomata, which was released in November 1979.\nUnder the hood, which hinged forwards, in the European style, the Opala originally offered only two engine choices: a 153\u00a0cu\u00a0in (2,512\u00a0cc) four-cylinder and a 230\u00a0cu\u00a0in (3,768\u00a0cc) straight-six. These engine were of traditional design for the era, with cast iron cylinder block and head, and overhead valves, actuated by pushrods and a camshaft mounted in the block, and pressed-steel rocker arms, whose spherical fulcrum was GM's proprietary design. Fuel was fed from either single or double-barrel carburetors. The engines had already been used for years in the USA: the 153\u00a0cu\u00a0in four had debuted in the 1962 Chevy II\u2014becoming the first inline four in a Chevrolet since 1928\u2014and the 230\u00a0cu\u00a0in six appeared in the 1963 Impala.  The 3.8\u00a0L six-cylinder was replaced by a bigger (4,093\u00a0cc or 250\u00a0cu\u00a0in) version in 1971. In 1973 GM do Brasil engineers decreased the four-cylinder engine's stroke to 3 inches and increased the length of the connecting rods to 6 inches to reduce vibrations, and simultaneously increased the bores to 4 inches diameter to keep the overall displacement (2,471\u00a0cc or 151\u00a0cu\u00a0in) similar to what it had been. (The bore and stroke of this Brazilian engine are exactly the same as the later Iron Duke engine designed and built by Pontiac, but the two engines are otherwise unrelated and do not share any parts.)\nThe six-cylinder engine's crankshaft had seven main bearings (there were five main bearings in the four-cylinders) and the generous (if not redundant) size of its inner moving parts attributed to its durability and exceptional smoothness. The hydraulic valve lifters made for easy maintenance. The straight-six's biggest limitation through the years was poor distribution of air-fuel mixture to the cylinders due to a sub-optimal intake manifold design. Cylinders one and six (on the ends of the engine), received the lowest ratio, with a higher percentage of air in the mixture, while the central ones tended to get a richer mixture, unbalancing the engine's stoichiometric efficiency. Basically, in order to ensure the outer cylinders received a high enough air/fuel ratio to avoid detonation, the carburetor had to be set to run overly rich, which wasted fuel). This design flaw could easily be solved by installing a race intake manifold that sported two or three two-barrel carburetors, as in stock car racing. Only in 1994, with the arrival of multipoint injection in the Omega, was this problem finally addressed.\nThe performance of Opala 3.8\u00a0L was actually quite pleasing; with a top speed of 112.5\u00a0mph (181.1\u00a0km/h) and acceleration from 0 to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in about 11 seconds, it was the fastest Brazilian car of its time, losing the title the following year to the Dodge Dart whose 318ci V8 had more power and torque. The 2.5\u00a0L fours did not offer as much vigor, but had enough torque enough for everyday use. The main complaint with the four-cylinder engines was their roughness\u2014so rough that GM employees of the time called the engine \"little Toyota\", in allusion to the diesel engine installed in the locally built Toyota Bandeirante.\nBoth the Especial and Luxo had a manual gearbox, rear wheel drive, front independent suspension and rear live axle, both with coil springs. In front, the suspension components were anchored to one side, set in the unibody with screws, later known as the subframe. The tires were the first tubeless tires used on a car manufactured in Brazil. It had a diaphragmatic (or \"Chinese hat\") clutch spring, which was becoming popular throughout the world. The Opala SS, originally only available with the \"250\" engine, was the first version to receive a four-speed manual gearbox. This was coupled with a tachomete", "Graduate House is a residential college and an academic and professional meeting centre in Melbourne (Victoria, Australia) and a membership association for graduates of all universities across the world.\nAffiliated with The University of Melbourne as its eleventh college, the Graduate Union of the University of Melbourne Incorporated is located on the corner of Grattan Street and Leicester Street, Carlton, just south of the university's main Parkville campus and in the vicinity of University Square.\nThe unique feature of the Graduate Union is a focus on graduates. The residential facility, for example, has no undergraduates. Instead, the 120 residents are postgraduate students (e.g., masters and doctoral) from around the world, postgraduate fellows and scholars visiting Melbourne on sabbatical, or part of education, research, or professional development partnership with a university in Victoria.\nThe Graduate Union celebrated its centenary in 2011, having originated on 4 May 1911 when a group of graduates met for the purpose of founding an association. Less than two months later, the Melbourne University Graduates Association was formed with Sir John Monash as its first president for the three years before his commencing of war service in 1914.\nFollowing strong support from Sir Robert Menzies and a substantial gift from Sir Sydney Myer, the Graduate Union purchased and renovated old terrace houses \u2013 including Gladstone Terrace \u2013 in the late 1950s and the 1960s. With a further gift from Stella Langford in the late 1960s, three neighbouring terrace houses on Leicester Street were added to the entire complex.\nIn 2011, the Graduate Union comprised three linked buildings. The newest is the Stella Langford wing fronted by three terrace facades and holding three new conference and event rooms and luxury apartments. The middle section (main building) contains offices, conference rooms, and a restaurant and bar on the ground floor, together with three floors of rooms with separate bathrooms and a multi-story car park. The oldest section of the Graduate Union retains the comfort and elegance of its long history. It contains resident facilities (kitchen, dining room, lounge) together with a library and rooms with shared bathrooms.", "Jeremy Pelt (born November 4, 1976 in California) is an American jazz trumpeter.", "In the U.S. state of New Jersey, county routes exist in all 21 counties.  They are typically the fourth type of roadway classified below the Interstate Highway, the U.S. Route numbered highway and the state highway.  The County Route system is defined by two types in New Jersey.  First, 500 Series County Routes, also called state secondary routes (to the state highway), are county highways numbered in a statewide system with three-digit numbers that begin with 5. These roads form a second network of routes that supplement the facilitation of the State Routes. Each 500 Series route is unique and is not permitted to be duplicated in another county for a separate route.  The second category is defined as Non-500 Series County Routes.  Non-500 Series County Routes include 1-digit, 2-digit, 600 Series, 700 Series and 800 Series.  These, by definition, are discontinuous across county borders and must be contained entirely within that county.  Unlike 500 Series County routes, these route numbers are unique to each county, and are typically assigned to more local routes than the statewide 500-series county route system.  They are typically of a lesser classification of streets like minor arterials or collector roadways rather than major arterials or thoroughfares.  In the counties that use 600-series numbers, the selection of this range was coordinated within the state, gradually replacing older systems of mainly one- and two-digit routes.\nWith very rare exceptions (such as County Route 537), the 500 series follows the rule of cardinal direction used for Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes: even-numbered roads run east and west, while odd-numbered roads run north and south. East\u2013west routes tend to be numbered with the lowest numbers in the northern part of the state and the highest numbers in the southern part of the state, also like the U.S. Routes. In northern New Jersey, north\u2013south routes range from CR 501 in the east to CR 521 in the west, although numbering in the southern part of the state tends to be more haphazard.\nCounty route numbers have not wholly replaced the preexisting names of the local roads to which they were assigned. Street signs at major intersections will denote both the local road name and the county route number if it has one. Residents who live along county routes rarely, if ever, give their address as \"123 County Route 5xx\" unless no name for the route has been established, as is the case in some rural areas.",

It allows for easier item selection as the scanning is systematic and predictable. Three primary scanning patterns exist:\nIn circular scanning, individual items are arranged in a circle (like the numbers on a clock face) and the scanning indicator moves in a circle to scan one item at a time. Although circular scanning is visually demanding, it is the simplest scanning pattern as it is cognitively easy to master.\nIn linear scanning, items are usually arranged in a grid and the scanning indicator moves through each item in each row systematically. Although linear scanning is cognitively more demanding than circular scanning, it is relatively straightforward and easy to learn. However, it may be inefficient if there are many items in the set (e.g., in a grid consisting of 8 items per row, if the desired item were the 7th item in the 4th row, the scanning indicator would have to scan through 30 undesired items first before reaching the desired item.\nIn group-item scanning, items are grouped (e.g., by row, column, or other meaningful categories) and the scanning indicator will first scan by groups. Once the scanner selects the group his desired item belongs to, the scanning indicator will scan each item in the selected group. Among the variations of group-item scanning, the most common is row-column scanning where the items are grouped in rows.", "In March 1862, Farr came to Christchurch. He received many commissions from the Presbyterian church and designed churches at Akaroa (1860), both the original (1864) and the final (1876; demolished 2011) St Paul's Church, Christchurch in central Christchurch, Lyttelton (St John's Church, 1865, demolished in 2012), Kaiapoi (St Paul's Church, 1875, demolished 1976), Leeston (St David's Church, 1879), and Bealey Avenue in the Christchurch Central City (Knox Church (original church) 1880, demolished 1964). An architectural competition was held for a new Methodist church in Durham Street, which was won by architectural firm Crouch and Wilson from Melbourne. Farr came second in the 1863 competition and was engaged to undertake the construction supervision. Farr was chosen as the architect for the original Trinity Congregational Church. The church, built in stone, was opened with a series of opening services starting on 23 November 1864. By 1870, the church had become too small for the congregation, and there were problems with ventilation. Four architects were invited to provide designs for a new building: Farr, Benjamin Mountfort, William Armson and Robert Lawson. Although Farr was a Deacon of the Trinity Congregational Church and had designed the first church, the design of Mountfort was chosen, who was a devout Anglican. Farr's name is listed on the foundation stone as the church's Deacon.\nFarr's most notable work is the Normal School at Cranmer Square. He won the design competition against 11 others and put Robert Lawson into second place. After conversion to apartments in the 1980s, the complex became known as Cranmer Court. The buildings suffered significant damage in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and although the apartment owners collectively spent NZ$1m in emergency repairs, the buildings are now awaiting demolition.\nFrom 1870 to 1872, Farr was the Lyttelton Borough Council Surveyor. He designed and erected the first iron verandahs in New Zealand, at a shop in Cashel Street. At the Canterbury Jubilee Exhibition of 1900, Farr exhibited a bas-relief plan of Banks Peninsula, carved in wood, for which be received a gold medal.\nFarr designed Hambleden for George Gould, one of the notable early settlers of Christchurch.  The house, named after Gould's birthplace, prominently stood on the corner of Bealey Avenue and Springfield Road, and was the first house built on Bealey Avenue. After Gould's death in 1889, it was the residence of the Bishop of Christchurch, Churchill Julius, for a few years. It was demolished within days of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Another Christchurch residential design was Te Wepu for Henry Richard Webb. Located on Papanui Road, but with an entrance off a side street that was named Webb Street, the house is today used as a hotel and apartments and has been renamed Merivale Manor. The building is registered as Category II by NZHPT.\nFarr was engaged by George Henry Moore to design most of the buildings at Glenmark Station. Moore is described as a \"supremely successful runholder\" in New Zealand's pastoral history. Four separate NZHPT registrations cover various buildings of the station, designed to give expression to his wealth. The stables, built in the 1880s in concrete for 50 horses, have a Category I listing. The other three entries (ruins of original house, the Station Lodge, and the Station Manager's House) are listed as Category II.\nFarr designed the second (privately owned) Christchurch Town Hall. The first opened in 1857 to a design by Benjamin Mountfort and Isaac Luck on the south-west side of High Street in the section between Lichfield and Cashel. Farr's building opened in 1863 and was sited immediately to the right of the first town hall. Farr's design was in stone and suffered damage in the 1869 Christchurch earthquake, with the architect blamed for these structural problems, which caused the low point of his career. Farr's Town Hall was destroyed in a fire in April 1873.\nWilliam Armson, Benjamin Mountfort, Alexander Lean and Frederick Strouts formed the Canterbury", "By default, the table below is sorted in chronological order of appointment as a knight or dame.", "The Gate of the Virgin (\u03a0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) is a modern gate, envisaged in the town master plan by the Italian administration to allow vehicle traffic, but opened only in 1955 by the Greek administration.

Kot\u011bra's initial design, presented in 1907, was criticized for its exaggerated decoration and luxurious design. Moreover, the city did not have sufficient funds for such a grandiose design.

Bernard received the territory of L\u00fcneburg, whose principal town was Celle.\nFrom 1527 until 1642 the Principality of Harburg, seated in Harburg, was partitioned from L\u00fcneburg. In 1569, L\u00fcneburg was divided between Henry III (line of Dannenberg) and William VI (line of L\u00fcneburg), the sons of Ernest the Confessor, Bernard's great-great-grandson.\nA distant cousin of the line of L\u00fcneburg, Frederick Ulrich, who ruled the territories of Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Calenberg, died in 1634. After some dispute, his territories were divided in 1635 between the Dannenberg and Celle branches of the L\u00fcneburg line. Henry III's son Augustus became Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel and his descendants eventually ruled the Duchy of Brunswick.\nWilliam's first four sons ruled L\u00fcneburg in sequence from their father's death in 1592 to 1648. The fifth son, George received the territories of Calenberg and G\u00f6ttingen in 1635. In 1636 he moved the seat of the Dukes of Calenberg from Pattensen to the town of Hannover in the Calenberg territory. This was the nucleus of the state of Hanover, though the territory would have to wait until 1814 before receiving \"Hanover\" as its official name.\nIn 1648, the Duke of Calenberg inherited L\u00fcneburg from his uncle Frederick, the last survivor of William's five sons. From 1648 to 1705, L\u00fcneburg (the larger territory) was held by the senior of the L\u00fcneburg line, and Calenberg by the next junior.\nIn 1692, the Emperor promised to raise the Duke of Calenberg, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg to the rank of Elector.  This promotion did not become effective until it was recognized by the Imperial Diet in 1708, ten years after Ernest Augustus's death.\nIn the meantime, his son, George Louis, inherited L\u00fcneburg from his uncle in 1705, doubling Hanover's size.", "The Loire Valley is listed UNESCO World Heritage site since 30 November 2000 under the reference 933bis. The justification for the inscription of the territory is based on several criteria: its architectural heritage which includes the Ch\u00e2teaux of the Loire (criterion I), its exceptional cultural landscape (criterion II) and its cultural monuments, witnesses of the Renaissance and the century Enlightenment (criterion IV).\nThe list includes at this date 160 communes distributed in 2 regions (Pays de la Loire and Center-Val de Loire) and 4 departments (Maine-et-Loire, Loiret, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire) on a distance of 280 km long stretching from Sully-sur-Loire to Chalonnes.", "Space communication technology has steadily evolved from expensive, one-of-a-kind point-to-point architectures, to the re-use of technology on successive missions, to the development of standard protocols agreed upon by space agencies of many countries. This last phase has gone on since 1982 through the efforts of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), a body composed of the major space agencies of the world. It has 11 member agencies, 28 observer agencies, and over 140 industrial associates.\nThe evolution of space data system standards has gone on in parallel with the evolution of the Internet, with conceptual cross-pollination where fruitful, but largely as a separate evolution. Since the late 1990s, familiar Internet protocols and CCSDS space link protocols have integrated and converged in several ways; for example, the successful FTP file transfer to Earth-orbiting STRV 1B on January 2, 1996, which ran FTP over the CCSDS IPv4-like Space Communications Protocol Specifications (SCPS) protocols.  Internet Protocol use without CCSDS has taken place on spacecraft, e.g., demonstrations on the UoSAT-12 satellite, and operationally on the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. Having reached the era where networking and IP on board spacecraft have been shown to be feasible and reliable, a forward-looking study of the bigger picture was the next phase.\nThe Interplanetary Internet study at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was started by a team of scientists at JPL led by Vinton Cerf and the late Adrian Hooke. Cerf is one of the pioneers of the Internet on Earth, and currently holds the position of distinguished visiting scientist at JPL. Hooke was one of the founders and directors of CCSDS.\nWhile IP-like SCPS protocols are feasible for short hops, such as ground station to orbiter, rover to lander, lander to orbiter, probe to flyby, and so on, delay-tolerant networking is needed to get information from one region of the Solar System to another. It becomes apparent that the concept of a region is a natural architectural factoring of the Interplanetary Internet.\nA region is an area where the characteristics of communication are the same. Region characteristics include communications, security, the maintenance of resources, perhaps ownership, and other factors. The Interplanetary Internet is a \"network of regional internets\".\nWhat is needed then, is a standard way to achieve end-to-end communication through multiple regions in a disconnected, variable-delay environment using a generalized suite of protocols. Examples of regions might include the terrestrial Internet as a region, a region on the surface of the Moon or Mars, or a ground-to-orbit region.\nThe recognition of this requirement led to the concept of a \"bundle\" as a high-level way to address the generalized Store-and-Forward problem. Bundles are an area of new protocol development in the upper layers of the OSI model, above the Transport Layer with the goal of addressing the issue of bundling store-and-forward information so that it can reliably traverse radically dissimilar environments constituting a \"network of regional internets\".\nDelay-tolerant networking (DTN) was designed to enable standardized communications over long distances and through time delays. At its core is something called the Bundle Protocol (BP), which is similar to the Internet Protocol, or IP, that serves as the heart of the Internet here on Earth.  The big difference between the regular Internet Protocol (IP) and the Bundle Protocol is that IP assumes a seamless end-to-end data path, while BP is built to account for errors and disconnections \u2014 glitches that commonly plague deep-space communications.\nBundle Service Layering, implemented as the Bundling protocol suite for delay-tolerant networking, will provide general-purpose delay-tolerant protocol services in support of a range of applications: custody transfer, segmentation and reassembly, end-to-end reliability, end-to-end security, and end-to-end routing among them. The Bundle Protocol was first tested in space on the UK-D", "Jason Donell Andre Craft (born February 13, 1976 in Denver, Colorado) is a former American football cornerback.

He was appointed court painter of Louis-Philippe, the king of the French, who commissioned him to paint individual portraits of his large family. Winterhalter would execute more than thirty commissions for him.\nThis success earned the painter the reputation of a specialist in dynastic and aristocratic portraiture, skilled in combining likeness with flattery and enlivening official pomp with modern fashion.\nHowever, Winterhalter's reputation in artistic circles suffered. The critics, who had praised his debut in the salon of 1836, dismissed him as a painter who could not be taken seriously. This attitude persisted throughout Winterhalter's career, condemning his work to a category of his own in the hierarchy of painting. Winterhalter himself regarded his first royal commissions as a temporary intermission before returning to subject painting and the field of academic respectability, but he was a victim of his own success, and for the rest of his life he worked almost exclusively as a portrait painter. His success in this field made him rich. Winterhalter became an international celebrity enjoying Royal patronage.\nAmong his many regal sitters was also Queen Victoria. Winterhalter first visited England in 1842, and returned several times to paint Victoria, Prince Albert and their growing family, painting at least 120 works for them, a large number of which remain in the Royal Collection, on display to the public at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences. On display at Osborne House is Florinda, given by Victoria as a birthday present for Albert in 1852. Winterhalter also painted a few portraits of the aristocracy in England, mostly members of court circles. The fall of Louis-Philippe in 1848 did not affect the painter's reputation. Winterhalter went to Switzerland and worked in Belgium and England.\nPersistence saw Winterhalter survive from the fall of one dynasty to the rise of another. Paris remained his home until a couple of years before his death. In the same year, his marriage proposal was rejected, and Winterhalter remained a bachelor committed to his work.\nAfter the accession of Napoleon III, his popularity grew. From then on, under the Second Empire, Winterhalter became the chief portraitist of the imperial family and court of France. The beautiful French Empress Eug\u00e9nie became a favorite sitter, and she treated him generously. In 1855 Winterhalter painted his masterpiece: The Empress Eug\u00e9nie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting. He set the French Empress in a pastoral setting gathering flowers in a harmonious circle with her ladies in waiting. The painting was acclaimed and exhibited in the universal exposition in 1855. It remains Winterhalter's most famous work. The composition shows a marked similarity to Florinda and this gave rise to scandalous gossip that the Empress and her ladies had posed d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 for the earlier painting.\nIn 1852, he went to Spain to paint Queen Isabella II with her daughter. Russian aristocratic visitors to Paris also liked to have their portraits executed by the famous master. As the \"Painter of Princes\", Winterhalter was thereafter in constant demand by the courts of Britain (from 1841), Spain, Belgium, Russia, Mexico, the German states, and France. During the 1850s and 1860s, Winterhalter painted a number of important portraits of Polish and Russian aristocrats. In 1857, he painted the portrait of Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna.\nDuring the Second Mexican Empire in the 1860s, headed by Maximilian I of Mexico, Winterhalter was commissioned to paint portraits of the Imperial couple. The Empress consort of Mexico, Charlotte of Belgium was the daughter of Louise-Marie of France, Queen of the Belgians, whom Winterhalter painted at the beginning of his career in France. Some of Winterhalter's paintings of the Mexican monarchs still remain in their Mexico City palace, Chapultepec Castle, now the National Museum of History.", "The town hall was built on the site of the former Bergenvaarderskamer, a guild hall for the Amsterdam shippers and merchants to Bergen, Norway.

On 21 October 2004, DHL Express announced that it planned to move its European hub from Brussels to Leipzig, Germany (Vatry, France, was also considered but rejected). DHL's unions called a strike in response and paralyzed work for a day. On 8 November 2004, DHL Express invested \u20ac120 million in an Indian domestic courier, Blue Dart, becoming the majority shareholder in the company. \nIn 2005, Deutsche Post made an offer to buy the contract logistics company Exel plc, which had just acquired Tibbett & Britten Group. On 14 December 2005, Deutsche Post announced the completion of the acquisition of Exel. DHL integrated Exel into its logistics division, rebranding the division's services as DHL Exel Supply Chain. Following that acquisition, DHL had a global workforce of 285,000 people (500,000 people including DPWN and other sister companies) and roughly $65 billion in annual sales. \nIn 2006, DHL won a ten-year contract worth \u00a31.6 billion to run the NHS Supply Chain, part of the United Kingdom's National Health Service. Under the contract, DHL was responsible for providing logistics services for over 500,000 products to support 600 hospitals and other health providers in the UK.\nIn a 50/50 joint venture with Lufthansa Cargo, DHL Express co-founded a new cargo airline, AeroLogic, in 2007, based at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The carrier operated up to 11 Boeing 777F planes by 2012. In December 2007, DHL became the first carrier to transport cargo via wind-powered ships, flying MS Beluga Skysails kites. \nAs part of the NHS contract, DHL opened a new 250,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (23,000\u00a0m\u00b2) distribution centre in 2008 to act as a stock-holding hub for food and other products, with another distribution centre planned for opening in 2012. The two new distribution centres created about 1,000 new jobs. In May 2008, DHL Aviation moved its central depot to Leipzig, Germany, leading to improved service and timeliness to the European Union. In the same month, DHL Express announced restructuring plans for its United States network, including termination of its business relationship with ABX Air and a new contract with competitor UPS for air freight operations. Its cargo hub was also shifted from Wilmington to Louisville. The Air Line Pilots Association, International protested, but on 10 November 2008, DHL announced that it was cutting 9,500 jobs as it discontinued domestic air and ground operations within the United States due to economic uncertainty. However, it retained international services and was still in talks with UPS to transport DHL packages between U.S. airports. \nDHL ended domestic pickup and delivery service in the United States in 2009, effectively leaving UPS and FedEx as the two major express parcel delivery companies in the US. Limited domestic service was still available from DHL, with the packages tendered to USPS for local delivery. In April 2009, UPS announced that DHL and UPS had terminated negotiations without an agreement for UPS to provide airlift for DHL packages between airports in North America. DHL said in a statement, \"We have not been able to come to a conclusive agreement that is acceptable to both parties.\" DHL continued to use its current air cargo providers, ASTAR Air Cargo and ABX Air.\nIn 2013, the company opened a newly expanded and upgraded global hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Erlanger, Kentucky.", "As a young man Hope was employed as a carpenter, but he quickly came to prominence in paranormal circles after claiming to be able to capture images of spirits on camera. Hope produced his first spirit image in 1905. Soon afterwards he formed the Crewe Circle Spiritualist group, with himself as the leader.\nIn 1906, Hope managed to dupe William Crookes with a fake spirit photograph of his wife. Oliver Lodge revealed there had been obvious signs of double exposure \u2013 the picture of Lady Crookes had been copied from a wedding anniversary photograph. However, Crookes was a convinced spiritualist and claimed it was genuine evidence for spirit photography. Doubts were also raised about his spirit photography in 1908.\nHope was first exposed in 1920 by Edward Bush who had caught Hope out by using a trap. He used the fake name \"Wood\" and sent a letter to Hope with a photograph of a living person which he pretended was his deceased son. He later attended a sitting with Hope. Hope produced a \"spirit\" extra which was exactly the same as the photograph he had sent Hope and on it were the words \"Dear friend Wood\". The psychical researcher Whately Carington wrote regarding the exposure \"any reasonable person will say that Mr Bush had proved his case.\" In 1921, Mr DeVaga, a friend of the magician Harry Houdini, attended a sitting with Hope.

Evidence of neurodegeneration can be supported by an increased microglia density and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. Animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas which are involved in learning and spatial memory. The corticolimbic brain regions affected include the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. It was found that a heavy two-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex with resultant learning deficits in rats.\nIt is unclear how the frequency and length of these binge drinking sessions impacts brain damage in humans. Humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a three-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. An MRI brain scan found that levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a metabolite biomarker for neural integrity, was lower in binge drinkers. Additionally, abnormal brain metabolism, a loss of white brain matter in the frontal lobe, and higher parietal gray matter NAA levels were found. This shows a correlation between binge drinking, poor executive functioning, and working memory. A decrease in frontal lobe NAA levels is associated with impaired executive functioning and processing speed in neuro-performance tests.\nThe volume of the corpus callosum, a large white matter tract that connects the two hemispheres, is shown to decrease with alcohol abuse due to a loss of myelination. This integration between the two cerebral hemispheres and cognitive function is affected. A limited amount of myelin can be restored with alcohol abstinence, leading to transient neurological deficits.\nAlcohol abuse affects neurons in the frontal cortex that typically have a large soma, or cell body. This type of neuron is more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease and normal aging. Research is still being conducted to determine whether there is a direct link between excessive alcohol consumption and Alzheimer's disease.\nHigher order functioning of the cerebral cortex is organized by the cerebellum. In those with cerebral atrophy, Purkinje cells, or the cerebellar output neurons, in the vermis are reduced in number by 43%. This large reduction in purkinje cells causes a decrease in high order cerebral cortex organization. The cerebellum is also responsible for refining crude motor output from the primary motor cortex. When this refinement is missing, symptoms such as unsteadiness and ataxia will present. A potential cause of chronic alcoholic cerebellar dysfunction is an alteration of GABA-A receptor. This dysfunction causes an increase in the neurotransmitter GABA in cerebellar purkinje cells, granule cells, and interneurons leading to a disruption in normal cell signaling.", "The p-value was introduced by Karl Pearson in the Pearson's chi-squared test, where he defined P (original notation) as the probability that the statistic would be at or above a given level. This is a one-tailed definition, and the chi-squared distribution is asymmetric, only assuming positive or zero values, and has only one tail, the upper one. It measures goodness of fit of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures how likely the fit would be this bad or worse.\nThe distinction between one-tailed and two-tailed tests was popularized by Ronald Fisher in the influential book Statistical Methods for Research Workers, where he applied it especially to the normal distribution, which is a symmetric distribution with two equal tails. The normal distribution is a common measure of location, rather than goodness-of-fit, and has two tails, corresponding to the estimate of location being above or below the theoretical location (e.g., sample mean compared with theoretical mean). In the case of a symmetric distribution such as the normal distribution, the one-tailed p-value is exactly half the two-tailed p-value:\nSome confusion is sometimes introduced by the fact that in some cases we wish to know the probability that the deviation, known to be positive, shall exceed an observed value, whereas in other cases the probability required is that a deviation, which is equally frequently positive and negative, shall exceed an observed value; the latter probability is always half the former.\n\u2014\u2009Ronald Fisher, Statistical Methods for Research Workers\nFisher emphasized the importance of measuring the tail \u2013 the observed value of the test statistic and all more extreme \u2013 rather than simply the probability of specific outcome itself, in his The Design of Experiments (1935). He explains this as because a specific set of data may be unlikely (in the null hypothesis), but more extreme outcomes likely, so seen in this light, the specific but not extreme unlikely data should not be considered significant.", "Boston University School of Theology (BUSTH) is the oldest theological seminary of American Methodism and the founding school of Boston University, the largest private research university in New England.

The eggs, paint, and newspaper are arranged in such a way as to foreground a front-page article with the headline \"Il faut sauver le Congo\" (We must save the Congo) and the lede \"Des v\u00e9rit\u00e9s simples et des probl\u00e8mes difficile\" (Some simple truths and difficult problems).

Through radio and television interviews, Lennon explained his use of the term \"nigger\" as referring to any oppressed person. Several Black feminists, including Pearl Cleage, challenged Yoko Ono's statement: \"If Woman is the \"N\" of the World, what does that make Black Women, the \"N, N\" of the World?\"\nIn musician/artist Patti Smith's 1978 song Rock N Roll Nigger, Smith self-identifies as a \"nigger\" by virtue of feeling like an outsider. In an interview with Rolling Stone that same year Smith argued that Mick Jagger, a white British man, qualified as a \"nigger\".\nIn 1979, Artists Space hosted an exhibition of black and white photographs and charcoal drawings by artist Donald Newman entitled \"Nigger Drawings\". A coalition of artists and critics including Lucy Lippard, Carl Andre, May Stevens, Edit Deak, Faith Ringgold, and Howardena Pindell published an open letter criticizing the exhibition and organized two \"teach-in\" demonstrations. (Only one was held. A second was unsuccessful because the gallery locked the doors.) Another coalition of artists and critics including Roberta Smith, Laurie Anderson, Rosalind E. Krauss, Craig Owens, Douglas Crimp, and Stephen Koch published an open letter defending the exhibition and criticizing the protestors whom they accused of \"exploiting this sensitive issue as a means of attracting attention\" and \"insensitivity to the complexities of both esthetics and politics.\" Douglas Crimp told Seven Days \"It's damaging to think about the political issues and not the work.\" Donald Newman told The Village Voice \"a lot of what fed this controversy is that my art is real. I'm not some punk who sat down and scrawled these things.

Lutheranism was popular among German-descent townsfolk, and Calvinism among the nobility. A year after Luther made his theses public, they were preached in Danzig (Gda\u0144sk), and soon spread over West Prussia province of Poland. From there Protestantism spread to East Prussia, Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and other Polish provinces, as well as Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1573 the Protestants, commanding a majority in the Sejm (parliament), scored a major political victory by passing a law of religious tolerance, the Warsaw Confederation. Towards the end of the 16th century, it can be estimated (through the number of parishes) that about a seventh of the Christian population in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were Protestant. In the 16th century, Poland was a haven for many refugees fleeing persecution from less tolerant parts of Europe, harboring not only Catholics and Protestants, but also people of Orthodox, Judaic and even Muslim faiths.\nSoon after the words of Reformation reached Poland in the first half of the 16th century, Catholic authorities such as primate of Poland Jan \u0141aski and bishop and vice-chancellor Piotr Tomicki began issuing edicts condemning this movement, and garnered royal support for this course of action. In the second half of the century, key Polish counter-reformation figures included cardinal Stanislaus Hosius. bishop and royal secretary Martin Kromer, primate Stanis\u0142aw Karnkowski and Jesuits Piotr Skarga and Jakub Wujek. Key dates and events marking the beginning of counter-reformation in Poland were the establishment of the regular papal nunciature mission in 1555 (beginning with the arrival of Luigi Lippomano), arrival of the Jesuit order in 1564, and the synod of Piotrk\u00f3w's acceptance of the Decrees of Trent in 1577.\nAt first the agents of counter-reformation in Poland focused on persuasion, through they also relied heavily on legal discrimination, particularly the anti-Reformation royal decrees of Sigismund I of Poland. The Catholic Church in Poland succeeded in subordinating the Eastern Orthodox Church through the Union of Brest-Litovsk (1595\u20131596). Jesuit schools gained significant renown at that time. From the 17th century, agents of counter-reformation became increasingly intolerant, succeeding in introducing censorship, including the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Some Protestant denominations were banned, while others lost many churches and adherents. Construction of non-Catholic churches was banned in 1632. The pacifist Polish Unitarians (Polish Brethren) were expelled from Poland in 1658 for refusing to aid the country in the time of military need. In 1668 the Sejm made it illegal for Catholics to convert to another faith; in 1673 non-Catholics were forbidden to be ennobled. By the first half of the 18th century, Protestants were barred from most civil offices, including being elected to the Sejm.\nNonetheless, compared to many other European countries, the conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants was relatively peaceful. Non-Catholics were rarely sentenced to death for their beliefs; the most common punishments were fines or exile. Polish historian Janusz Tazbir coined a phrase \"state without stakes\", illustrating that the level of religious persecution and conflict in Poland was much lower than in most other European countries of that time, a fact that can be attributed to Protestant success in passing laws providing for religious toleration in the 16th century, and later, to the weakness of the Polish central state, which the resurgent Catholics were unable to use to implement more violent methods of conversion or reconversion (such as burning at the stake).  Many Protestant nobles converted back to Catholicism to increase their chances of receiving favorable positions from Catholic-leaning monarchs; others did so to prove that they were \"patriots\".\nMany scholars agree that \"Poland was one of the great successes of the Counter", "As with other cyanotoxins, microcystins were named after the first organism discovered to produce them, Microcystis aeruginosa. However it was later found other cyanobacterial genera also produced them. There are about 60 known variants of microcystin, and several of these can be produced during a bloom. The most reported variant is microcystin-LR, possibly because the earliest commercially available chemical standard analysis was for microcystin-LR.\nBlooms containing microcystin are a problem worldwide in freshwater ecosystems. Microcystins are cyclic peptides and can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans. They bioaccumulate in the liver of fish, in the hepatopancreas of mussels, and in zooplankton. They are hepatotoxic and can cause serious damage to the liver in humans. In this way they are similar to the nodularins (below), and together the microcystins and nodularins account for most of the toxic cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and brackish waters. In 2010, a number of sea otters were poisoned by microcystin. Marine bivalves were the likely source of hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning. This was the first confirmed example of a marine mammal dying from ingesting a cyanotoxin.", "Allocasuarina thalassoscopica is a species of Allocasuarina native to Australia.\nThe shrub typically grows to a height of 1 metre (3\u00a0ft).\nIt has a limited range and is restricted to a small area in south east Queensland and north-east New South Wales.", "Anticipating the outbreak of another world war, the Polish Navy implemented the Peking Plan in late August and early September 1939, moving three modern destroyers, Burza, B\u0142yskawica, and Grom to Britain; the ships served alongside (and under the command of) the Royal Navy for the remainder of the war.\nOn 3 September, the UK and France declared war on Germany as obliged by the Anglo-Polish military alliance. The declaration was made 24 hours after the UK had issued an ultimatum to Germany to withdraw all German forces from Poland. After the fall of Poland, the Royal Navy was strengthened by the arrival of two Polish submarines Orze\u0142 and Wilk. The Polish Navy in the United Kingdom was then supplemented with leased British ships.\nThe British Army immediately began dispatching the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to support France. At first only regular troops from the pre-war Army made up its numbers. In 1940, however, men of the Territorial Army (TA) divisions being mobilized in the UK were sent. In the end, the BEF had I, II and III Corps under its command, controlling 200,000 men. The Royal Air Force (RAF) also sent significant forces to France at the start of hostilities. Some were French Army cooperation squadrons to help with matters like reconnaissance for the French Army. Others were Hawker Hurricane squadrons from RAF Fighter Command. Separately, Bomber Command sent the Advanced Air Striking Force, composed of squadrons flying the Fairey Battle and other machines that did not have the range to reach Germany from the UK.\nDuring the Phoney War, the RAF carried out small bombing raids and a large number of propaganda leaflet raids (code-named \"Nickels\") and the Royal Navy imposed a coastal blockade on Germany.", "Central High School, also known as High School of Columbus and High School of Commerce, was a four-year secondary school (grades 9\u201312) located  in Columbus, Ohio.

Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.\nThe extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which uses water and gravity to concentrate the valuable minerals, or hard rock mining, which pulverizes the rock containing the ore and then relies on chemical reactions to concentrate the sought-after material.  In the latter, the extraction of minerals from ore requires comminution, i.e., grinding the ore into fine particles to facilitate extraction of the target element(s).  Because of this comminution, tailings consist of a slurry of fine particles, ranging from the size of a grain of sand to a few micrometres.

His efforts begin on June 15, 1863. During this time, Meigs often operated in active theaters of war. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton called his service improving these defenses \"meritorious and dangerous\".\nDuring General Robert E. Lee's retreat from the Battle of Gettysburg (July 4 to July 23), Meigs assisted in keeping the telegraph and roads open along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) line between Washington and Harpers Ferry. His small unit of engineers skirmished with pickets of Lee's retreating forces near Harpers Ferry about July 13.\nOn July 23, 1863, Meigs was assigned as an engineer to the staff of Brigadier General Benjamin Franklin Kelley. He was also assigned as an engineer and acting aide-de-camp on the staff of Brigadier General (Volunteers) William W. Averell. He engaged in extensive surveying of the area and drew hundreds of topographical maps, and assisted in designing and overseeing the construction of defensive works.  He also reconnoitered on behalf of General Averell's troops on several occasions. He participated in the Battle of Rocky Gap on August 26 to 27, 1863, near White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Meigs was made Chief Engineer of the Shenandoah Valley for the Department of West Virginia (a Union military district) on November 3, staying in the position until August 17, 1864. On November 6, he participated in the Battle of Droop Mountain in West Virginia, and the pursuit of Confederate forces after the battle from November 6 to 18. Meigs was detached from Kelley's command on November 23.\nMeigs continued to participate in military action as part of Averell's command.

Rani Gumpha \"Cave of the Queen\"\nRani Gumpha is the largest and most popular cave among the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri. The word 'Rani' means Queen. Although it is not an architectural marvel, it has some ancient beautiful sculptures.\nThis cave is double storeyed. Each storey has three wings and the central wing is bigger among all the three wings. The lower floor has seven entrances in the middle wing whereas the upper floor has nine columns. The upper portion of the central wing has relief images depicting the victory march of a king. Many of the cells have carved dwara pala images; some of them are disfigured. The area that connects the central wing with right and left wings have some panels where the sculptures of wild animals, fruit-laden trees, human figures, women playing musical instruments, monkeys and playful elephants are found. The pilasters contain the toranas (arches) decorated with sculptures of Jain religious importance and royal scenes.\n2. Bajaghara Gumpha\nBajaghara Gumpha is very simple and small. It has stone bed and pillow and it was obviously used as the Jain monks' shelter in the ancient times. Apart from the plain rectangular shaped pillars, there is no other sculpture found in this cave.\n3. Chota Hathi Gumpha\nChota Hathi Gumpha is small in size. It has six small elephant figures in the facade and a statue of a guardian.\n4. Alakapuri Gumpha\nAlakapuri Gumpha has a relief sculpture of a lion holding its prey in its mouth. The pillars with the human figures (divine beings) with wings are found in this cave. It is double storeyed.\n5. Jaya Vijaya Gumpha\nJaya Vijaya Gumpha is double storeyed.

The other two inscriptions talk about Kudepasiri, the successor of Kharavela and Badukha, the son or brother of Kudepasiri.\n10. Ganesha Gumpha\nGanesha Gumpha is one of the most important caves in Udayagiri. The cave got this name due to carved figure of Ganesha on the back of its right cell. Of course, it would have been carved in the later period and it cannot be the original work. The cave has two big statues of elephants carrying garlands at the entrance and is the first example of sculpture animals used as guard to the entrance.

Horses used in exhibition or competition may have far more extensive grooming.  However, the tail's main purpose is fly protection, and certain types of show grooming can inhibit the use of this natural defense.\nIn show grooming, the dock of the tail (the flesh-covered part of the tail where the hair is rooted) and the \"skirt\" (the hair below the tip of the dock) may be styled in a wide variety of ways: The tail may be kept natural and encouraged to grow as long as possible, and sometimes even has additional hair artificially attached.  Other times, it may be clipped, thinned, or even cut very short.  A few breeds are shown with docked tails.\nA \"natural\" tail is neither clipped nor braided when the horse is presented in the ring. The tail may be encouraged to grow as long as possible, often by keeping the skirt of the tail in a long braid when not in competition, usually also folded up and covered by a wrap to keep it clean. The shorter hairs of the dock are allowed to hang loose so that the horse can still swat flies.  \"Natural\" tails can also be thinned and shaped by pulling hairs at the sides of the dock or by pulling the longest hairs in the skirt of the tail, to make the tail shorter and less full, though still retaining a natural shape.\nTail hairs are also cut.  \"Clipping\" the tail usually refers to trimming the sides of the dock, to a point about halfway down the dock. Banging the tail involves cutting the bottom of the tail straight at the bottom.  In modern competition, this is usually done well below the hocks.  Tail extensions, also known as \"false tails,\" or \"tail wigs,\" are false hairpieces which are braided or tied into the tail to make it longer or fuller.\nBraiding the dock of the tail in a French braid with the skirt left loose is commonly seen in hunter competition and hunt seat equitation. In polo, draft horse showing and on Lipizzan horses that perform the capriole, the entire tail, dock, and skirt are generally braided and the braid is folded or rolled into a knot, with or without added ribbons and other decorative elements.  In inclement weather, many other show disciplines will allow competitors to put up the skirt of the tail into a similar type of stylized knot known as a mud tail.\nIn the draft horse and some harness breeds, the tail is cut very short to keep it from being tangled in a harness.  The term \"docked\" or \"docking\"  may simply mean cutting the hair of the tail skirt very short, just past the end of the natural dock of the tail. However, it can also refer to partial tail amputation. This type of docking is banned in some places, and either type of docking can make it difficult for a horse to effectively swat flies.  Another controversial practice, tail setting, involves placing the dock of the tail in a device that causes it to be carried at all times in an arched position desired for show. The set is used when the horses are stalled, and removed during performances.  It stretches the muscles to keep the tail in position, and is not used after the horse is retired from competition. Sometimes the process is sped up by the controversial practice of nicking or cutting the check ligament that normally pulls the tail downward.  This practice is generally only used for a few breeds, such as the American Saddlebred.", "Sir Roger Newdigate, 5th Baronet (30 May 1719 \u2013 23 November 1806) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons between  1742 and 1780.

None of the species are very tolerant of severe winter cold, with the hardiest, P. borbonia, P. ichangensis and P. lingue, surviving temperatures down to about \u221212\u00a0\u00b0C (10.4\u00a0\u00b0F); they also require continuously moist soil, and do not tolerate drought. A number of these species are found in forests that face threats of destruction or deforestation; for example, P. meyeniana in Central Chile.\nThe family Lauraceae was part of the land flora of Gondwana, and many genera had migrated to South America via Antarctica over ocean landbridges by the time of the Paleocene. From South America they spread over most of the continent. When the North American and South American tectonic plates joined in the late Neogene, volcanic mountain building created island chains which later formed the Mesoamerican landbridge. Pliocene elevation created new habitats for speciation. While some genera died out in increasingly xerophytic mainland Africa, starting with the freezing of Antarctica about 20 million years ago and the formation of the Benguela current, others, which also reached South America and Mesoamerica, such as Beilschmiedia and Nectandra are still surviving today in Africa in a number of species. The genus, however, died out in Africa, except for P. indica, which is, today, a threatened species that survives in the fog-shrouded mountains of the Canary Islands.\nFossil evidence indicates that the genus originated in West Africa during the Paleocene, and spread to Asia, to South America, and to Europe and thence to North America. It is thought that the gradual drying of Africa, west Asia, and the Mediterranean from the Oligocene to the Pleistocene, and the glaciation of Europe during the Pleistocene, caused the extinction of the genus across these regions, resulting in the present distribution.\nSince this habitat is constantly threatened by encroaching agriculture, the laurel forest animal or vegetal species have already become rare in many of its former habitats and are threatened by further habitat loss.\nIn Mesoamerica, Persea proliferated into many new species, and the berries of some of them constitute a valuable food supply for quetzals, trogoniform birds that live in the montane rainforests of Mesoamerica. In particular, the resplendent quetzal's favorite fruits are berries of wild relatives of the avocado. Their differing maturing times in the cloudforest determine the migratory movements of the quetzals to differing elevation levels in the forests. With a gape width of 21\u00a0mm (0.83\u00a0in), the quetzal swallows the small berry (aguacatillo) whole, which he catches while flying through the lower canopy of the tree, and then regurgitates the seed within 100 meters (328\u00a0ft) from the tree. Wheelright in 1983 observed that parent quetzals take far less time intervals to deliver fruits to the young brood than insects or lizards, reflecting the ease of procuring fruits, as opposed to capturing animal prey. Since the young are fed exclusively berries in the first 2 weeks after hatching, these berries must be of high nutritional value. Usually only the total percentage of water, sugar, nitrogen, crude fats and carbohydrates are reported by ornithologists.\nPersea species are also used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including giant leopard moth, Coleophora octagonella (which feeds exclusively on P. carolinensis) and Hypercompe indecisa.", "Cr\u00e9teil-Pompadour is a railway station located in Cr\u00e9teil, Val-de-Marne, Paris, France.

California's north-south midway division is around 37\u00b0 latitude, near the level of San Francisco.  Popularly, though, \"Northern California\" usually refers to the state's northernmost 48 counties. Because of California's large size and diverse geography, the state can be subdivided in other ways as well.  For example, the Central Valley is a region that is distinct both culturally and topographically from coastal California, though in northern versus southern California divisions, the Sacramento Valley and most of the San Joaquin Valley are usually placed in northern California.\nThe state is often considered as having an additional division north of the urban areas of the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento metropolitan areas. Extreme northern residents have felt under-represented in state government and in 1941 attempted to form a new state with southwestern Oregon to be called Jefferson, or more recently to introduce legislation to split California into two or three states.  The coastal area north of the Bay Area is referred to as the North Coast, while the interior region north of Sacramento is referred by locals as the Northstate.\nNorthern California was used for the name of a proposed new state on the 2018 California ballot created by splitting the existing state into three parts.", "AWA Superstars of Wrestling / Wrestling Superstars Live\nAWA Superstars/WSL World Light Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nAWA Superstars World Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with T.J.

In 1887, the Committee of the Mechanics' Institute decided that the town's apprentices required technical instruction for the rapidly expanding engineering advances being made at the turn of the nineteenth century. This resulted in the creation of the new Technical School with student numbers rising to more than 1,500.\nIn 1926, Bolton Technical School became a college. Fifteen years later a new building was opened offering a wide range of technical education choices, with engineering the most popular. In 1964, Bolton Technical College and Bolton Institute of Technology were divided into two separate organisations.

In 1946, de la Cruz founded the Feminine Party of Chile.  These actions were the culmination of a long struggle that began in 1913 and ended in 1949, when President Gabriel Gonz\u00e1lez Videla signed the law that granted the right to vote in all elections to women in Chile.\nThe Feminine Party grew up very quickly among middle-class and working women. In 1948, de la Cruz ran for a senate seat, but even though she had the support of Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo, she lost the election. During the 1952 presidential election, she became Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's campaign manager.  After he won the presidency, he offered her a position in his cabinet as Minister of Education, but she refused, nominating instead Mar\u00eda Teresa del Canto from her own party.\nIb\u00e1\u00f1ez then backed her as a candidate to replace him in the senate.

Nonetheless, her political career ended abruptly a few months later.  Her powerful oratory gained her suspicion and enmity from all political sectors. Three women accused her to be involved in the smuggling of watches from Argentina. These accusations grew until they became the Watches affair. On August 4, 1953, she was indicted and stripped of her position for \"abusing her position for personal gain\", even though the congressional investigation had voted against that measure.

Missouri voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.\nOn March 15, 2016, in the presidential primaries, voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for president. Voters could choose any one party's primary in which to vote.\nDonald Trump won the election in Missouri with 56.4% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 37.9% of the vote. Trump's 18.5-point margin of victory in the state was almost double that of Mitt Romney's from 2012. Clinton carried only four jurisdictions: Boone County, home to Columbia and the University of Missouri; Jackson County, which includes most of Kansas City; St. Louis County; and St. Louis City.\nWith 37.9% of the vote, Hillary Clinton obtained the lowest percentage as a Democratic presidential nominee in the state since George McGovern's 37.7% in 1972, further cementing the state's drift towards the Republican Party, and away from its long held status as a bellwether state.

The population was 3,949 at the 2010 census.", "As land gastropods such as land snails and land slugs have no sense of hearing and very limited vision, they rely heavily on chemoception, primarily olfaction, and tactile perception. Mate location is also greatly mediated by airborne chemicals. Slugs often raise their head at the detection of pheromones in the air, and then turn to orient themselves and crawl towards the perceived source. Many slugs also exhibit some degree of mucus-trail-following in order to locate a mate. Trail following may be an alternative or complementary strategy to airborne cues, and can constitute a major part of precourtship behaviour.\nUsing mucus trails to find a mate involves the discrimination between conspecific and heterospecific trails. It is therefore advantageous to incorporate species specific cues into trails to facilitate mate finding. In some species, such as banana slugs (Ariolimax), pheromones are secreted together with the mucus to attract mates. It may even be possible for a follower to perform a quality assessment of a potential mate based on its mucus trail. The mucus may reveal information on body size or parasite infection, giving an insight into fecundity. A larger size suggests a slug is highly fertile, whereas parasitism could mean it suffers from decreased egg production or even sterility.\nTrail following is a complex behavioural pattern which usually involves the active participation of both slugs. The follower keeps very close to the leader once they are in proximity. In species with pronounced trail following, such as Deroceras panormitanum, the leader flattens its tail laterally and waves it from side to side in front of the follower. It is not yet known whether tail waving is a visual cue or whether it wafts chemical attractants in the direction of the follower. Sometimes, the tail is waved between the follower's tentacles and occasionally makes contact, contributing to recognition between the slugs. The leading slug seemingly pauses to wait for the follower, tail waving, if the follower falls too far behind.", "Overtime, the population of Chattisham has had a diverse range in job roles, as portrayed in the 1881 and 2011 data sets. From the 2011 census data of Chattisham, one person was unemployed. This can be seen as a positive for the village, as the other 127 people are involved in full/part-time jobs, study, care and retirement. This data does not include people under the age of 16. As shown in the 2011 employment industry chart, retail and manufacturing have the highest proportion of people. The industries with the lowest proportion of people include, 'Public administration & defence' and 'other'. This data set is based on resident's aged 16 to 74, on the 2011 census. The occupational statistics for 1881, suggest that 'agriculture' had the highest number of workers in total than any other sector. The agricultural sector mainly consisted of male workers, with an approximation of '45 males'. In 1881, '30 women' were under the sector 'Persons without specified occupants.

In an effort to extend education to more Quebecois students, the government had created a system of CEGEPs to create a facilitated pathway into university.  However, Quebec did not have enough French-language universities to accommodate the new influx of students applying after completing CEGEP.  Only 40% of CEGEP graduates could be accommodated by existing Francophone universities, and job prospects were poor for students who only had a certificate from a CEGEP.  As a result, student protests began to spread across the province, with 23 CEGEPs, the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, and Universit\u00e9 Laval being occupied by student protesters.  Thousands of Francophone students took to the streets in protest, as others barricaded themselves inside their CEGEPs, refusing to leave until their demands were met.\nAlthough the students' demands were often not met and individual protests proved largely unsuccessful, they had captured the attention of Quebec's legislators.  Partially as a result of this upheaval, Quebec's government decided to pass a resolution which would create a new network of Francophone universities across the province of Quebec.  With the province in the midst of the Quiet Revolution, secularism was becoming pertinent to Quebec society and to a new generation of youth who rejected Catholic domination over Quebecois society, and alternatives to the traditional, existing religious institutions were demanded.  Five universities were established in 1969 and 1970 to assuage the influx of CEGEP students, and they were placed in cities across the province to allow equal educational opportunities in areas where access to higher education had traditionally been limited, such as Rimouski and Abitibi.  In the 1970s, a sixth university would be added to the network, the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais in Gatineau.

The area was an important portage route for Native Americans, and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario.\nWhen the Town of York, the predecessor of Toronto, was inaugurated in the 1790s, the land to the east and west of the garrison (later Fort York) was reserved for military purposes. This includes all of today's Exhibition Place. Years later, the British military decided to replace Fort York with New Fort York (later the Stanley Barracks), to be located to the west of the existing fort. To finance this, the military sold the eastern half of the reserve. In 1840\u20131841, they constructed a series of six limestone buildings and several smaller ones. The fort was surrounded by a wood fence as elaborate defensive works were never built. The fort was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870, which named it Stanley Barracks in 1893.\nThe Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for Canada West inaugurated the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 fair, to be held in Toronto, a permanent \"Palace of Industry\" exhibition building, based on London's Crystal Palace, was built at King and Shaw Streets in what is now Liberty Village. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s when the City of Toronto government decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today's Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the Massey Manufacturing Company.\nThe 1878 Provincial Agricultural Fair was held on the grounds. When Ottawa was chosen to host the 1879 fair, Toronto decided to hold its own fair. First called the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, it was held in the Crystal Palace and temporary buildings. At first, the eastern part of the site was still reserved for military purposes, the exhibition held on the western part of the reserve, where many of the oldest exhibit buildings are located. As time went by, more and more of the reserve was taken over for exhibition purposes, including a horse track and grandstand, and exhibit buildings.", "Van Vleck Independent School District operates schools in the area.", "There are many ways to customize a multiple-necked guitar, such as the number of strings on a neck, frets or no frets, the tuning used on each neck, etc. One of the earliest designs still in regular use is the acoustic contraguitar, invented around 1850 in Vienna. This guitar, also known as the Schrammel guitar, has a fretted six-string neck and a second, fretless neck with up to nine bass strings.\nOne of the more common combinations is where one neck of a double-necked guitar is set up as for a 6 string guitar and the other neck is configured as a 4 string bass guitar. Guitarist Pat Smear of the Foo Fighters utilizes a double-necked guitar during live performances (bass guitar top neck, six-string electric guitar bottom neck) in order to perform Krist Novoselic's bass part in the song \"I Should Have Known,\" from the album Wasting Light, in addition to his own duties. Rickenbacker International Corporation and Gibson Guitar Corporation in the US have both manufactured production models of these configurations in the past.\nA less common configuration has a 12 string guitar neck combined with a 4 string bass guitar neck: Geddy Lee of Rush is well known for using the 4/12-string Rickenbacker 4080/12 production model live in the 1970s.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Mike Rutherford of Genesis was known for playing a custom-made Shergold Modulator twin-neck guitar-bass unit in live shows, as he frequently changed between lead guitar, 12-string guitar and bass guitar, depending on the arrangement of the song. The unique design of this guitar set is that it consists of several modular elements, that could be separated and combined by a system of dowels and thumbscrews, including an electrical connection. The complete set originally consisted of a 6-string guitar \"top-section\", two 12-string guitar \"top-sections\" to have different tunings readily available, and a 4-string bass \"bottom-section\". The bass section could be attached to any of the top-sections to create a variety of twin-neck combinations. (Additionally there was a smaller lower-body-section which could be attached to any of the top-sections when they were not in use as part of a double-neck configuration, to complete the shape of a single guitar.)\nAs a tongue-in-cheek reference to Rutherford's frequent use of this double-neck guitar, the puppet version of Rutherford in the video for Land of Confusion plays a four-necked guitar.", "Historically, European Jews have been classified into two major groups: the Ashkenazim, or \"Germanics\" (\"Ashkenaz\" meaning \"Germany\" in Medieval Hebrew), denoting their Central European base, and the Sephardim, or \"Hispanics\" (\"Sefarad\" meaning \"Hispania\" or \"Iberia\" in Hebrew), denoting their Spanish, Portuguese or North African base. A third historic term Mizrahim, or \"Easterners\" (\"Mizrach\" being \"East\" in Hebrew) has been used to describe other non-European Jewish communities to the east, but its usage has changed both over time and relative to the location where it was used. One definition is the Jews who never left the Middle East, in contrast to the Sephardim who went west to Spain, Portugal, and North Africa. A similar three-part distinction in the Jewish community of 16th-century Venice is noted by Johnson as being \"divided into three nations, the Penentines from Spain, the Levantines who were Turkish subjects, and the Natione Tedesca or Jews of German origin...\" The far more recent meaning of the term, to include both Middle Eastern and North African Jews in a single term, developed within Zionism in the mid-1940s, when Jews from these countries were all combined in one category as the target of an immigration plan. According to some sources, the current sense of the term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born Jews, was invented at this time. The term constitutes a third major layer to some, and following the partition of Mandatory Palestine and Israeli independence, the Mizrahim's often-forced migration, led to their re-established communities in Israel.\nSmaller Jewish groups include the Georgian Jews and Mountain Jews from the Caucasus; Indian Jews including the Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews and Bene Ephraim; the Romaniotes of Greece; the ancient Italian Jewish community; the Teimanim from the Yemen; various African Jews, including most numerously the Beta Israel of Ethiopia; the Bukharan Jews of Central Asia; and Chinese Jews, most notably the Kaifeng Jews, as well as various other distinct but now extinct communities.\nThe divisions between all these groups are rough and their boundaries aren't solid. The Mizrahim for example, are a heterogeneous collection of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities which are often as unrelated to each other as they are to any of the earlier mentioned Jewish groups. In traditional religious usage and sometimes in modern usage, however, the Mizrahim are also termed Sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy, despite independent evolutions from Sephardim proper. Thus, among Mizrahim there are Iranian Jews, Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, Sudanese Jews, Tunisian Jews, Algerian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Lebanese Jews, Kurdish Jews, Libyan Jews, Syrian Jews, and various others. The Yemenite Jews (\"Teimanim\") from Yemen are sometimes included, although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in Mizrahim. Additionally, there is a difference between the pre-existing Middle Eastern and North African Jewish communities as distinct from the descendants of those Sephardi migrants who established themselves in the Middle East and North Africa after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain by the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, and in 1497 from the expulsion decreed in Portugal.\nDespite this diversity, Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, estimated at between 70% and 80% of all Jews worldwide; prior to World War II and the Holocaust however, it was 90%. Ashkenazim developed in Europe, but underwent massive emigration in search of better opportunities and during periods of civil strife and warfare. As a result of this, they became the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents and countries, which previously were without native European or Jewish populations. These include the United States, Mexico, Canada, United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, but with Venezuela and Panama being exceptions since Sephardim still compose the majority of the Jewish communities i", "Comets are small Solar System bodies, typically only a few kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye.\nShort-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale\u2013Bopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets whose volatiles have mostly been driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.", "Carphophis amoenus, commonly known as the worm snake, is a species of nonvenomous colubrid endemic to the eastern United States. C. amoenus can be found east of the Mississippi, from southwest Massachusetts south to southern Alabama west to Louisiana  and then north to Illinois. This species of snake protects a large range, and normally prefers a moist habitat in the rocky woodlands, under rotten wood of logs and stumps. Though this snake is quite abundant over its range, it is rarely seen because of its dormant lifestyle and where it usually resides. This snake is most common on the edges or in the ecotonal areas of open to thick woodlands, and the borders of wetlands. It may also be found in the grasslands next to woodlands. The best chance to spot it  is after heavy rains, when its small size and distinct color make it easy to spot.  This species prefers moist soil inhabited by earthworms, which are its main prey, so the soil needs to be sufficiently moist. The snake's skin naturally evaporates water; so the soil needs to be moist enough to offset this. C. amoenus is mostly found under rocks and in sufficient leaf litter during the extreme daytime heat.", "After Marwan's 732 expedition, a period of quiet set in. Marwan was replaced as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns during the two years of his governorship.

In the meantime, Marwan is reported to have gone before Caliph Hisham and remonstrated against the policy followed in the Caucasus, recommending that he himself be sent to deal with the Khazars, with full authority and an army of 120,000 men. When Sa'id requested to be relieved in 735 due to his failing eyesight, Hisham appointed Marwan to replace him.\nMarwan returned to the Caucasus determined to launch a decisive blow against the Khazars, but it appears that he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions for some time. He established a new base of operations at Kasak, some twenty parsangs from Tiflis and forty from Bardha'a, but his initial expeditions were against minor local potentates. In 735, Marwan captured three fortresses in Alania, near the Darial Pass, and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, who was restored to his lands by the Caliph as a client ruler. In the next year, Marwan campaigned against another local prince, Wartanis, whose castle was seized and its defenders killed despite their surrender; Wartanis himself tried to flee, but was captured and executed by the inhabitants of Khamzin. Indeed, Agapius and Michael the Syrian record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace during this period, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay as a short-lived ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations and mislead the Khazars as to his intentions.\nMarwan prepared a massive strike for 737, intended to end the war for good. Marwan apparently went to Damascus in person to persuade Hisham to back this project and was successful: the 10th-century historian Bal'ami claims that his army numbered 150,000 men, comprising regular forces of Syria and the Jazira, as well as volunteers for the jihad, Armenian troops under Ashot Bagratuni, and even armed camp followers and servants. Whatever the real size of Marwan's army, it was a huge force and certainly the largest ever sent against the Khazars. Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot. He then pushed into Caucasian Iberia, driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast, in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia. Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself, but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops.\nMarwan now launched a two-pronged offensive against the Khazars: 30,000 men (including most of the levies from the Caucasian principalities) under the governor of Derbent, Asid ibn Zafir al-Sulami, advanced north along the coast of the Caspian Sea, while Marwan himself with the bulk of his forces crossed the Darial Pass. The invasion met little resistance; the Arab sources report that Marwan had deliberately detained the Khazar envoy and only let him go with a declaration of war once he was deep in Khazar territory. The two Arab armies converged on Samandar, where a great review was held; according to Ibn A'tham, the troops were issued new clothing in white\u2014the dynastic colour of the Umayyads\u2014as well as new spears. From there Marwan pushed on, reaching, according to some Arab sources, the Khazar capital of al-Bayda on the Volga. The khagan withdrew towards the Ural Mountains, but left behind a considerable force to protect the capital. This was a \"spectacularly deep penetration\", according to Blankinship, but of little strategic value: the 10th-century travellers Ibn Fadlan and Istakhri describe the Khazar capital in their time as little more than a large encampment, and there is no evidence that", "This article lists the oldest extant buildings in the state of Connecticut in the United States of America, including houses and any other surviving structures.

These animals were selected based on specific sacred markings which were believed to indicate their fitness for the role. Some of these cult animals retained their positions for the rest of their lives, as with the Apis bull worshipped in Memphis as a manifestation of Ptah. Other animals were selected for much shorter periods. These cults grew more popular in later times, and many temples began raising stocks of such animals from which to choose a new divine manifestation. A separate practice developed in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, when people began mummifying any member of a particular animal species as an offering to the god whom the species represented. Millions of mummified cats, birds, and other creatures were buried at temples honoring Egyptian deities. Worshippers paid the priests of a particular deity to obtain and mummify an animal associated with that deity, and the mummy was placed in a cemetery near the god's cult center.", "Magdalenengarten mainly consists of eight squares four of which form a rosarium with 1,500 roses and a pavilion of climbing roses.

The most commonly used form of the K\u00f6ppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.\nRain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 and 2,000\u00a0mm (69 and 79\u00a0in). A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with rainfall between 750 and 1,270\u00a0mm (30 and 50\u00a0in) a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia. The humid subtropical climate zone is  where winter rainfall is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones. Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 degrees away from the equator.\nAn oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.

At that time, the collective farm named Petrovsky had two trucks GAZ-51 (drivers Pylypenko Mykola Okafiyovych and Kolesnik Dmitri Tihonovich), 25 oxen, 100 horses (the horse team was there where is the house 145 in Postniy street now). They took tractors from MTS. The collective farm land amounted to 3200\u20133500 hectares.\nIn the period 1954\u20131959 the chairman of the collective farm was Ivan P. Barylchenko, awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor in 1958. During this time the villagers built the double and four-row cow-houses (the head of dairy farms was Dorozhon A.S), a garage, put up water pipes (before this they carried water with milkmaid's yokes from three wells). The collective farmer's working day lasted 12 hours (from 7\u00a0am to 7\u00a0pm). They worked hard on fields, farms, and corn floors. In arid 1954 farmers got 200 grams (7.1\u00a0oz) of bread for one workday unit, and in 1955 they sewed their clothes of cloak-tents.

Over the years, they built a pig farm, a poultry farm and a sheep farm. The village was spreading, the number of tractors, combine-harvesters, machinery were increasing, the heads of the collective farm replaced each other. From 1960 the chairman of the kolkhoz was Ivan Moysa, from 1967 it was Boris T. Bershadskiy, later Bilov Ivan, from 1976 Vereshchak S. In the period from 1966 to 1972 the garage housed 40 various vehicles (garage foreman Mikhail Pilipenko).

They were all well received, but the authorities of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique remained unmoved. Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as Herv\u00e9. At his theatre, the Folies-Nouvelles, which had opened the previous year, Herv\u00e9 pioneered French light comic opera, or \"op\u00e9rette\". In The Musical Quarterly, Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, \"Without the example set by Herv\u00e9, Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers, La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and so many other triumphant works.\" Offenbach approached Herv\u00e9, who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called Oyayaye ou La reine des \u00eeles. It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received. Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as \"a charming piece of nonsense\". The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by Herv\u00e9, shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat. Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique.\nOffenbach had chosen his theatre, the Salle Lacaze in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The location and the timing were ideal for him. Paris was about to be filled between May and November with visitors from France and abroad for the 1855 Great Exhibition. The Salle Lacaze was next to the exhibition site. He later wrote:\nIn the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, there was a little theatre to let, built for [the magician] Lacaze but closed for many years. I knew that the Exhibition of 1855 would bring many people into this locality. By May, I had found twenty supporters and on 15 June I secured the lease. Twenty days later, I gathered my librettists and I opened the \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens\".\nThe description of the theatre as \"little\" was accurate: it could only hold an audience of at most 300. It was therefore well suited to the tiny casts permitted under the prevailing licensing laws: Offenbach was limited to three speaking (or singing) characters in any piece. With such small forces, full-length works were out of the question, and Offenbach, like Herv\u00e9, presented evenings of several one-act pieces. The opening of the theatre was a frantic rush, with less than a month between the issue of the licence and the opening night on 5 July 1855. During this period Offenbach had to \"equip the theatre, recruit actors, orchestra and staff, find authors to write material for the opening programme \u2013 and compose the music.\" Among those he recruited at short notice was Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, the nephew of Offenbach's early mentor Fromental Hal\u00e9vy. Ludovic was a respectable civil servant with a passion for the theatre and a gift for dialogue and verse. While maintaining his civil service career he went on to collaborate (sometimes under discreet pseudonyms) with Offenbach in 21 works over the next 24 years.\nHal\u00e9vy wrote the libretto for one of the pieces in the opening programme, but the most popular work of the evening had words by Moinaux. Les deux aveugles, \"The Two Blind Men\" is a comedy about two beggars feigning blindness. During rehearsals there had been some concern that the public might judge it to be in poor taste, but it was not only the hit of the season in Paris: it was soon playing successfully in Vienna, London and elsewhere. Another success that summer was Le violoneux, which made a star of Hortense Schneider in her first role for Offenbach. Aged 22, when she auditioned for him, she was engaged on the spot. From 1855 she was a key member of his companies through much of his career.\nThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1855 were not yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an unpaved all\u00e9e.

The plot, which was owned by Miss Anne Griffith-Jones (1890\u20131973), was transferred to the Diocese on the understanding that a church would be built on it. To get things going, the British Army donated a sum of RM$1,000 to the church. Further to this, they also gave it a dismantled Nissen hut.

When President Calvin Coolidge decided to spend his Christmas holidays on Sea Island in 1928, the new hotel gained national attention. Promoted as a quiet, worry-free escape, as opposed to some of the high-energy resorts in Florida, the Cloister appealed to businessmen, politicians, and celebrities, including New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Edsel Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Eddie Rickenbacker, and many others. In addition to the hotel, Mr. Coffin also dreamed of creating a residential community on the island and encouraged his guests to consider building \"cottages\" nearby. To that end, he brought in electricity, water and telephone service, and improved causeway access to both St. Simons and Sea Islands. Among those building homes was Eugene O\u2019Neill, who wrote the play Ah, Wilderness! while there.\nAlthough growth slowed during the Great Depression, the still modest resort was able to make it through the financial crisis and World War II. In the postwar years, the Cloister and its surrounding community grew slowly, with the hotel welcoming a steady stream of distinguished guests, including U.S. presidents Hoover, Eisenhower, Ford and Carter. In 1949, Sarah Churchill married photographer Anthony Beauchamp on the island. Among the thousands of honeymooners to visit were George and Barbara Bush. The island\u2019s residential community also grew in numbers and in stature, with some lot prices pushing into the millions of dollars by the end of the 20th century.", "The University of Michigan added permanent lighting to Michigan Stadium in time for the event.

It was constructed in 1180, probably on the site of an earlier Benedictine monastery built in 1160 by Domnall Mac Gilla Patraic, King of Osraige. Jerpoint is notable for its stone carvings, including one at the tomb of Felix O'Dulany, Bishop of the Diocese of Ossory when the abbey was founded.\nDuiske Abbey in Graiguenamanagh founded in 1204 was one of the first and largest Cistercians monasteries in Ireland. What remains of the monastery is a large gothic church which dominates the town centre in Graiguenamanagh.

It is a National Monument and is in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. The priory is scenically situated alongside King's River, about fifteen kilometres south of Kilkenny. One of its most striking feature is a collection of medieval tower houses spaced at intervals along and within walls which enclose a site of just over 3 acres (12,000\u00a0m\u00b2).

This injected a substantial political diversion into White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 ranks.\nThis Prometheist period also witnessed a development that was independent of the movement, but which would ultimately play a role in regard to it. There was heightened diversionary activity in Poland by the OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), supported by both Germany and Czechoslovakia and even by Lithuania. There were many acts of expropriation and sabotage against the Polish community and government by members of OUN combat units in southeastern Poland. This in turn led to \"pacification\" operations by the Polish authorities against the Polish-Ukrainian community.\nThe pacifications, Charaszkiewicz emphasizes, were never discussed in advance with Polish Promethean officials. Those at the Foreign Ministry and at the General Staff were not pleased with these operations, which made Promethean activities that much more difficult.\nA greater shock to the Prometheists, Polish and Ukrainian, however, was the death of Tadeusz Ho\u0142\u00f3wko, murdered by OUN members on August 29, 1931, at Truskawiec.\nCharaszkiewicz is far from blaming all of Poland's difficulties with her minorities, especially the Ukrainians (who in most of southeastern interwar Poland were the majority), on external, especially German, influences. He argues that Poland had \"no planned, consistent and constructive internal policy\" with regard to her minorities. This lack could not bode well for the Promethean effort, when every fifth Polish citizen (that is, six million people) were Ukrainian.\nMoreover, the Soviet Union sought to an equal degree to exploit Poland's internal disarray \u2014 indeed, in 1921\u201331, to a greater degree than the Germans. Soviet communist propaganda in Poland's Eastern Borderlands (Kresy Wschodnie), combined with a pro-Ukrainian Soviet attitude toward Soviet Ukraine, created strong pro-Soviet sentiment among Polish Ukrainians. This sentiment would persist until the subsequent mass Soviet resettlements, arrests, executions and famines of 1933\u201338.\nThe period 1926\u201332 was marked by the participation of a large number of Poles in the Promethean endeavor:\nat the Foreign Ministry: Tadeusz Ho\u0142\u00f3wko, Tadeusz Schaetzel, Stanis\u0142aw Hempel, Adam Tarnowski, Miros\u0142aw Arciszewski, Roman Knoll, Juliusz \u0141ukasiewicz, Marian Szumlakowski, Stanis\u0142aw Za\u010bwilichowski, Jan Gawro\u0144ski, Zygmunt Mostowski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Zaleski, Kazimierz Marian Wyszy\u0144ski, Karol Dubicz-Penther, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Pelc, Ksawery Zalewski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wolski, Piotr Kurnicki, Wac\u0142aw Knoll;\nat the General Staff: Brig.

According to CAPCOM Shanon Lucid, the song was dedicated to not only the entire crew, but also to all \"the men and women who put their heart and soul into the shuttle program for all these years\".\nThe weather outlook for the landing was promising, with 10-mile (16\u00a0km) visibility and 1\u00a0mph (1.6\u00a0km/h) crosswinds. Flight controllers decided against delaying the landing until daylight, citing the excellent weather conditions. The crew was given a \"go\" to start \"fluid loading\", which involved drinking large amounts of liquids and salt tablets. The protocol assists the incoming astronauts from space with weightlessness conditions to re-adapt to Earth's gravity.\nThe de-orbit burn occurred at 4:49:04\u00a0a.m. EDT for three minutes and 17 seconds to decelerate the craft over the Indian Ocean near northwestern Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The shuttle was re-oriented into forward, right-side-up free-flight. The Shuttle crew continued its descent and entered the earth's atmosphere around 5:25\u00a0a.m. EDT. Shuttle technicians moved onto the shuttle landing site around 5:35\u00a0a.m. EDT. The craft eventually decelerated to coast at 223 miles per hour (359\u00a0km/h). The Space Shuttle landed at the Kennedy Space Center on runway 15 at 5:57:00 am EDT. Nose Gear touch down occurred at 5:57:20 am EDT. Wheelstop occurred at 5:57:54 am EDT.\nRecognizing the conclusion of an era, Mission Commentator Rob Navias declared on nose wheel touchdown \"Having fired the imagination of a generation, a ship like no other, its place in history secured, the shuttle pulls into port for the last time. Its voyage, at an end.\" Just after wheels stop, also recognizing the historical enormity of the final landing, Commander Chris Ferguson said \"Mission complete, Houston, After serving the world for over 30 years, the shuttle has earned its place in history, and it has come to a final stop.\" to which Entry CAPCOM Barry Wilmore replied \"We congratulate you, Atlantis, as well as the thousands of passionate individuals across this great space faring nation who truly empowered this incredible spacecraft which for three decades has inspired millions around the globe. Job well done America!\" Ferguson replied \"The Space Shuttle changed the way we viewed the world. It's changed the way we view our universe. There's a lot of emotion today, but one thing is indisputable: America's not gonna stop exploring. Thank you Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Endeavour and our ship Atlantis. Thank you for protecting us and bringing this program to such a fitting end. God bless The United States of America.\"\nHundreds turned out at Kennedy Space Center to witness the last landing of a Space Shuttle. An estimated 4,000 shuttle program workers also gathered to watch TV coverage at the Johnson Space Center in Texas. Inside Mission Control, team members shook hands, hugged and took pictures of each other experiencing the historical occasion.\nAfter working through the checklists to safely power down the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew performed the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Ferguson did note that the door to the Waste Collection System in the shuttle's mid-deck flew open during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston the next day.\nAtlantis was towed back to Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF-2) where a walk-around for NASA/Kennedy Space Center employees was held.

Fish, wine and oil are allowed on Saturdays and Sundays, and oil and wine are allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, except in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\nThe fasting rules permit fish, wine and oil on certain feast days that occur during the course of the fast: Evangelist Matthew (November 16), Apostle Andrew (November 30), Great-martyr Barbara (December 4), St. Nicholas (December 6), St. Spiridon and St. Herman (December 12), St. Ignatius (December 20), etc.  The Nativity Fast is not as severe as Great Lent or the Dormition Fast.\nAs is always the case with Orthodox fasting rules, persons who are ill, the very young or elderly, and nursing mothers are exempt from fasting. Each individual is expected to confer with their confessor regarding any exemptions from the fasting rules, but should never place themselves in physical danger.\nThere has been some ambiguity about the restriction of fish, whether it means the allowance of invertebrate fish or all fish. Often, even on days when fish is not allowed, shellfish may be consumed.  More detailed guidelines vary by jurisdiction, but the rules strictly state that from the December 20 to December 24 (inclusively), no fish may be eaten.\nThe Eve of Nativity (December 24) is a strict fast day, called Paramony (lit. \"preparation\"), on which no solid food should be eaten until Sirius is seen in the evening sky (or at the very least, until after the Vesperal Divine Liturgy that day). If Paramony falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the day is not observed as a strict fast, but a meal with wine and oil is allowed after the Divine Liturgy, which would be celebrated in the morning.", "Schlaitz is a village and a former municipality in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

Efforts in this direction would eventually materialized in the form of the single-seat Mirage IIIE; a two-seat trainer variant of the aircraft was also developed, designated as the Mirage IIID. On 5 April 1961, the first of a batch of three prototypes performed its first flight.\nThe Mirage IIIE considerably differed from the earlier Mirage IIIC interceptor. In terms of its airframe, the aircraft possessed a 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) forward fuselage extension, which had been made to increase the size of the avionics bay, located directly behind the cockpit. The stretch had also enabled its fuel capacity to be expanded, which had been deemed necessary after several pilots had criticized the Mirage IIIC for having been quite limited in terms of its range.\nMany Mirage IIIEs were fitted with a British-built Marconi continuous-wave Doppler navigation radar radome on the bottom of the fuselage, underneath the cockpit; in contrast, none of the Mirage IIICs were provided with this apparatus. A similar inconsistent variation was the presence or absence of a high frequency (HF) antenna fitted as a forward extension to the vertical tailplane; on some Mirages, the leading edge of the tailplane was a straight line, while on those with the HF antenna the leading edge had a sloping extension forward. The extension appears to have been generally standard on production Mirage IIIAs and Mirage IIICs, but only appeared in some of the Mirage IIIE's export versions. The Mirage IIIE featured Thomson-CSF Cyrano II dual mode air / ground radar; a radar warning receiver (RWR) system with the antennas mounted in the vertical tailplane; and an Atar 09C engine, the latter being equipped with a petal-style variable exhaust.\nOn 14 January 1964, the first production Mirage IIIE was delivered to the AdA, over time, 192 aircraft were eventually delivered to that service.

He wrote: \"[The skyscraper] must be tall, every inch of it tall. The force and power of altitude must be in it the glory and pride of exaltation must be in it. It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing, rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line.\" His 1896 article cited his Wainwright Building as an example. Despite the classical column concept, the building's design was deliberately modern, featuring none of the neoclassical style that Sullivan held in contempt.\nHistorian Carl W. Condit described the Wainwright as \"a building with a strong, vigorously articulated base supporting a screen that constitutes a vivid image of powerful upward movement.\" The base contained retail stores that required wide glazed openings; Sullivan's ornament made the supporting piers read as pillars. Above it the semi-public nature of offices up a single flight of stairs are expressed as broad windows in the curtain wall. A cornice separates the second floor from the grid of identical windows of the screen wall, where each window is \"a cell in a honeycomb, nothing more\". The building's windows and horizontals were inset slightly behind columns and piers, as part of a \"vertical aesthetic\" to create what Sullivan called \"a proud and soaring thing.\" This perception has since been criticized as the skyscraper was designed to make money, not to serve as a symbol.\nThe ornamentation for the building includes a wide frieze below the deep cornice, which expresses the formalized yet naturalistic celery-leaf foliage typical of Sullivan and published in his System of Architectural Ornament, decorated spandrels between the windows on the different floors and an elaborate door surround at the main entrance. \"Apart from the slender brick piers, the only solids of the wall surface are the spandrel panels between the windows. ... . They have rich decorative patterns in low relief, varying in design and scale with each story.\"  The frieze is pierced by unobtrusive bull's-eye windows that light the top-story floor, originally containing water tanks and elevator machinery. The building includes embellishments of terra cotta, a building material that was gaining popularity at the time of construction.\nOne of Sullivan's primary concerns was the development of an architectural symbolism consisting of simple geometric, structural forms and organic ornamentation. The Wainwright Building where he juxtaposed the objective-tectonic and the subjective-organic was the first demonstration of this symbolism.\nUnlike Sullivan, Adler described the building as a \"plain business structure\" stating:\nIn a utilitarian age like ours it is safe to assume that the real-estate owner and the investor in buildings will continue to erect the class of buildings from which the greatest possible revenue can be obtained with the least possible outlay ... The purpose of erecting buildings other than those required for the shelter of their owners is specifically that of making investments for profit.\nThe building is considered the first skyscraper to forgo the normal ornamentation used on skyscrapers at the time.\nSome architectural elements from the building have been removed in renovations and taken to the Sauget, Illinois storage site of the St. Louis Building Arts Foundation.", "General James Ferguson (August 15, 1913 \u2013 July 13, 2000) was a U.S. Air Force general and was commander of the Air Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.", "Hortob\u00e1gyi palacsinta is a savoury Hungarian Cr\u00eape, filled with meat (usually veal).

In 1895, the Tour & Taxis site was selected by the Belgian State and the City of Brussels as the location for a new commercial station along the Brussels Canal. Construction of the Tour & Taxis industrial complex, spread over 37\u00a0ha (91 acres) of land, officially began on 22 July 1900, with King Leopold II present for the inaugural festivities.\nTour & Taxis was one of the first multi-modal freight transport platforms in the world. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bruneel served as the main engineer for the project, while Ernest Van Humbeeck, Constant Bosmans and Henri Vandeveld worked as architects. Central to the site's functionality was the Gare Maritime (Dutch: Maritiem Station) freight station, constructed by Bruneel beginning in 1902 and open from 1907. The expansive 40,000\u00a0m\u00b2 (430,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) steel and glass structure was designed to efficiently receive goods by land, water and rail. Major sources of cargo included sugar, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and chocolate. Customs and excise duties were then collected on-site via the H\u00f4tel des Douanes, and goods were stored in bonded warehouses\u2014the Entrep\u00f4t Public and the Entrep\u00f4t Royal\u2014before their redistribution. The Gare Maritime was controlled by the Belgian State Railways (and, from 1926, the National Railway Company of Belgium), while the bonded warehouses were managed by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme du Canal et des Installations maritimes de Bruxelles (and later, the Port of Brussels).\nThe buildings have been recognised for the quality of their construction. According to La Fonderie, Brussels Museum of Industry and Labour, the Tour & Taxis site is a \"catalogue of architecture and civil engineering\", as well as \"a testament to the skills of Belgian engineers and workers, and their mastery of steel, iron, stone, glass and concrete.\" Their appearance was influenced by both the Flemish Renaissance and the Art Nouveau style characteristic of early 20th-century Brussels.\nThe busy Tour & Taxis site furthered industrial and economic development in Brussels. According to La Fonderie, \"construction of the complex and the port resulted in the development of the surrounding area, where life soon revolved around the packaging, storage, sale and transportation of different cargoes... Outstanding industrial buildings sprang up, followed by residential buildings and workers' housing estates. The Tour & Taxis complex was a hive of social and economic activity. In its heyday at the end of the 1960s, it employed a workforce of almost 3,000.\"\nAs Europe's economic landscape shifted over the latter half of the 20th century, so too did Tour & Taxis' importance as a centre of commerce and industry. The Treaty of Rome in 1957, of which Belgium was a signing member, created the European Economic Community (EEC) and initiated Europe's move away from economic borders and towards a single market via reduced customs duties and the establishment of a customs union. At the same time, Belgium's expansion of its roads and highways in the 1960s and 1970s (see Transport in Belgium) facilitated the increased transport of goods by road versus waterways or railways. The free movement of capital and goods within the EEC (and, from 1993, the European Union), combined with the changing means by which those goods were distributed within member states, gradually made the original function of the buildings at Tour & Taxis irrelevant. The Entrep\u00f4t Public and the Entrep\u00f4t Royal were rented out to private companies for storage space, but building maintenance became too expensive for the railway and port companies to maintain. By the 1990s, the Port of Brussels and the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB) each put their shares of the Tour & Taxis property up for sale.", "The Most Noble Order of the Garter was founded by Edward III of England in 1348.

It refers to the renaming of Jacob, who, according to the Bible, wrestled with an angel, who gave him a blessing and renamed him Israel because he had \"striven with God and with men, and have prevailed\". The Hebrew Bible etymologizes the name as from yisra \"to prevail over\" or \"to struggle/wrestle with\", and El (God). However, modern scholarship interprets El as the subject, \"El rules/struggles\", from sarar (\u05e9\u05b8\u05c2\u05e8\u05b7\u05e8) 'to rule' (cognate with sar (\u05e9\u05b7\u05c2\u05e8) 'ruler', Akkadian \u0161arru 'ruler, king'), which is likely cognate with the similar root sara (\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8\u05d4) \"fought, strove, contended\".\nThe name Israel first appears in non-biblical sources c. 1209 BCE, in an inscription of the Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah. The inscription is very brief and says simply: \"Israel is laid waste and his seed is not\" (see below). The inscription refers to a people, not to an individual or a nation-state.", "The Lt.

Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.\nAround 5.9\u00a0million years ago, the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt deposition range, during what is known as the Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.\nIt is estimated that, were the Strait closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the Mediterranean basin would evaporate within only a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then, and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.\nAfter a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33\u00a0million years ago, the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since. The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the Strait (900\u00a0m (3,000\u00a0ft; 490 fathoms) at the narrows, 280\u00a0m (920\u00a0ft; 150 fathoms) at the Camarinal Sill).

Because of the building's height, the Clal Center quickly became a popular venue for suicide jumpers who leaped from the upper-story windows.

Flowers of wind-pollinated plants tend to lack petals and or sepals; typically large amounts of pollen are produced and pollination often occurs early in the growing season before leaves can interfere with the dispersal of the pollen. Many trees and all grasses and sedges are wind-pollinated, as such they have no need for any flowers.\nPlants have a number of different means to attract pollinators including color, scent, heat, nectar glands, edible pollen and flower shape. Along with modifications involving the above structures two other conditions play a very important role in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants, the first is the timing of flowering and the other is the size or number of flowers produced. Often plant species have a few large, very showy flowers while others produce many small flowers, often flowers are collected together into large inflorescences to maximize their visual effect, becoming more noticeable to passing pollinators. Flowers are attraction strategies and sexual expressions are functional strategies used to produce the next generation of plants, with pollinators and plants having co-evolved, often to some extraordinary degrees, very often rendering mutual benefit.\nThe largest family of flowering plants is the orchids (Orchidaceae), estimated by some specialists to include up to 35,000 species, which often have highly specialized flowers that attract particular insects for pollination. The stamens are modified to produce pollen in clusters called pollinia, which become attached to insects that crawl into the flower. The flower shapes may force insects to pass by the pollen, which is \"glued\" to the insect. Some orchids are even more highly specialized, with flower shapes that mimic the shape of insects to attract them to attempt to 'mate' with the flowers, a few even have scents that mimic insect pheromones.\nAnother large group of flowering plants is the Asteraceae or sunflower family with close to 22,000 species, which also have highly modified inflorescences that are flowers collected together in heads composed of a composite of individual flowers called florets.  Heads with florets of one sex, when the flowers are pistillate or functionally staminate or made up of all bisexual florets, are called homogamous and can include discoid and liguliflorous type heads.  Some radiate heads may be homogamous too.  Plants with heads that have florets of two or more sexual forms are called heterogamous and include radiate and disciform head forms, though some radiate heads may be heterogamous too.", "The order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb is a regular hyperbolic honeycomb in 3-space, and one of eleven paracompact honeycombs in 3-space.\nThere are nine uniform honeycombs in the [6,3,6] Coxeter group family, including this regular form. \nThis honeycomb has a related alternated honeycomb, the triangular tiling honeycomb, but with a lower symmetry:  \u2194 .\nThe order-6 hexagonal tiling honeycomb is part of a sequence of regular polychora and honeycombs with triangular tiling vertex figures:\nIt is also part of a sequence of regular polychora and honeycombs with hexagonal tiling cells:\nIt is also part of a sequence of regular polychora and honeycombs with regular deltahedral vertex figures:", "The city has an average elevation of 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).\nThe urban area of Antofagasta begins abruptly, breaking the monotony of the desert and is located in the coastal plains, south of Mejillones Peninsula and north of \"Cerro Coloso\".

One of the four sons of Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, he is associated with a wide range of concepts, including the night sky, the night winds, hurricanes, the north, the earth, obsidian, enmity, discord, rulership, divination, temptation, jaguars, sorcery, beauty, war and strife. His name in the Nahuatl language is often translated as \"Smoking Mirror\" and alludes to his connection to obsidian, the material from which mirrors were made in Mesoamerica and which were used for shamanic rituals and prophecy. Another talisman related to Tezcatlipoca was a disc worn as a chest pectoral. This talisman was carved out of abalone shell and depicted on the chest of both Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca in codex illustrations.\nHe had many epithets which alluded to different aspects of his deity: Titlacauan /\u02cct\u026atl\u0259\u02c8ka\u028a\u0259n/ (\"We Are His Slaves\"), Ipalnemoani (\"He by Whom We Live\"), Necoc Yaotl (\"Enemy of Both Sides\"), Tloque Nahuaque (\"Lord of the Near and the Nigh\") and Yohualli \u00c8hecatl (\"Night, Wind\"), Ome Acatl (\"Two Reed\"), Ilhuicahua Tlalticpaque (\"Possessor of the Sky and Earth\").\nWhen depicted he was usually drawn with a black and a yellow stripe painted across his face. He is often shown with his right foot replaced with an obsidian mirror, bone, or a snake\u2014an allusion to the creation myth in which he loses his foot battling with the Earth Monster. Sometimes the mirror was shown on his chest, and sometimes smoke would emanate from the mirror. Tezcatlipoca's nagual, his animal counterpart, was the jaguar and his jaguar aspect was the deity Tepeyollotl (\"Mountainheart\"). In the Aztec ritual calendar the Tonalpohualli Tezcatlipoca ruled the trecena 1 Ocelotl (\"1 Jaguar\")\u2014he was also patron of the days with the name Acatl (\"reed\").\nThe Tezcatlipoca figure goes back to earlier Mesoamerican deities worshipped by the Olmec and Maya. Similarities exist with the patron deity of the K'iche' Maya as described in the Popol Vuh.  A central figure of the Popol Vuh was the god Tohil whose name means \"obsidian\" and who was associated with sacrifice.
